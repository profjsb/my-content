 abstract = {The ability to manipulate domains underpins function in applications of
ferroelectrics. While there have been demonstrations of
controlled nanoscale manipulation of domain structures to drive
emergent properties, such approaches lack an internal feedback
loop required for automatic manipulation. Here, using a deep
sequence-to-sequence autoencoder we automate the extraction of
latent features of nanoscale ferroelectric switching from
piezoresponse force spectroscopy of tensile-strained
PbZr$_0.2$Ti$_0.8$O$_3$ with a hierarchical domain
structure. We identify characteristic behavior in the
piezoresponse and cantilever resonance hysteresis loops, which
allows for the classification and quantification of nanoscale-
switching mechanisms. Specifically, we identify elastic
hardening events which are associated with the nucleation and
growth of charged domain walls. This work demonstrates the
efficacy of unsupervised neural networks in learning features of
a material's physical response from nanoscale multichannel
hyperspectral imagery and provides new capabilities in
leveraging in operando spectroscopies that could enable the
automated manipulation of nanoscale structures in materials. <P
