 abstract = {We present broadband radio observations of the afterglow of GRB 000301C,
spanning from 1.4 to 350 GHz for the period of 3-130 days after
the burst. These radio data, in addition to measurements in the
optical bands, suggest that the afterglow arises from a
collimated outflow, i.e., a jet. To test this hypothesis in a
self-consistent manner, we employ a global fit and find that a
model of a jet expanding into a constant-density interstellar
medium (ISM+jet) provides the best fit to the data. A model of
the burst occurring in a wind-shaped circumburst medium (wind-
only model) can be ruled out, and a wind+jet model provides a
much poorer fit of the optical/IR data than the ISM+jet model.
In addition, we present the first clear indication that the
reported fluctuations in the optical/IR are achromatic, with
similar amplitudes in all bands, and possibly extend into the
radio regime. Using the parameters derived from the global fit,
in particular a jet break time
t$_jet$åisebox-0.5ex~7.3 days, we infer a
jet opening angle of
\ensuremathþeta$_0$\i̊sebox-0.5ex~0.2
rad; consequently, the estimate of the emitted energy in the GRB
itself is reduced by a factor of 50 relative to the isotropic
value, giving
E\rs̊ebox-0.5ex~1.1×10$^51$
