 abstract = {We use the first compilation of 72 core-collapse supernovae (SNe) from
the Palomar Transient Factory (PTF) to study their observed
subtype distribution in dwarf galaxies compared to giant
galaxies. Our sample is the largest single-survey, untargeted,
spectroscopically classified, homogeneous collection of core-
collapse events ever assembled, spanning a wide host-galaxy
luminosity range (down to M$_r$ \ensuremath≈ -14
mag) and including a substantial fraction (&gt;20%) of dwarf
(M$_r$ &gt;= -18 mag) hosts. We find more core-collapse SNe
in dwarf galaxies than expected and several interesting trends
emerge. We use detailed subclassifications of stripped-envelope
core-collapse SNe and find that all Type I core-collapse events
occurring in dwarf galaxies are either SNe Ib or broad-lined SNe
Ic (SNe Ic-BL), while ``normal'' SNe Ic dominate in giant
galaxies. We also see a significant excess of SNe IIb in dwarf
hosts. We hypothesize that in lower metallicity hosts,
metallicity-driven mass loss is reduced, allowing massive stars
that would have appeared as ``normal'' SNe Ic in metal-rich
galaxies to retain some He and H, exploding as Ib/IIb events. At
the same time, another mechanism allows some stars to undergo
extensive stripping and explode as SNe Ic-BL (and presumably
also as long-duration gamma-ray bursts). Our results are still
limited by small-number statistics, and our measurements of the
observed N(Ib/c)/N(II) number ratio in dwarf and giant hosts
(0.25$^+0.3$ $_-0.15$ and 0.23$^+0.11$ $_-0.08$,
respectively; 1\ensuremathσ uncertainties) are
consistent with previous studies and theoretical predictions. As
additional PTF data accumulate, more robust statistical analyses
will be possible, allowing the evolution of massive stars to be
probed via the dwarf-galaxy SN population.},
