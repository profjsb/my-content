 abstract = {We study the duration and variability of late-time X-ray flares
following gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) observed by the narrow-field
X-ray telescope (XRT) aboard the Swift spacecraft. These flares
are thought to be indicative of late-time activity by the
central engine that powers the GRB and produced by means similar
to those which produce the prompt emission. We use a
nonparametric procedure to study the overall temporal properties
of the flares and a structure function analysis to look for an
evolution of the fundamental variability timescale between the
prompt and late-time emission. We find a strong correlation in
28 individual X-ray flares in 18 separate GRBs between the flare
duration and their time of peak flux since the GRB trigger. We
also find a qualitative trend of decreasing variability as a
function of time since trigger, with a characteristic minimum
variability timescale \ensuremathÎ”t/t=0.1 for most
flares. The correlation between pulse width and time is
consistent with the effects of internal shocks at ever-
increasing collision radii, but could also arise from delayed
activity by the central source. Contemporaneous detections of
high-energy emission by GLAST could test between these two
scenarios, as any late-time X-ray emission would undergo inverse
Compton scattering as it passes through the external shock. The
profile of this high-energy component should depend on the
distance between the emitting region and the external shock.},
