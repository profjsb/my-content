 abstract = {The number of long gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) known to have occurred in the
distant Universe (z &gt; 5) is small (̃15); however, these
events provide a powerful way of probing star formation at the
onset of galaxy evolution. In this paper, we present the case
for GRB 100205A being a largely overlooked high-redshift event.
While initially noted as a high-z candidate, this event and its
host galaxy have not been explored in detail. By combining
optical and near-infrared Gemini afterglow imaging (at t &lt;
1.3 d since burst) with deep late-time limits on host emission
from the Hubble Space Telescope, we show that the most likely
scenario is that GRB 100205A arose in the range 4 &lt; z &lt;
8. GRB 100205A is an example of a burst whose afterglow, even at
̃1 h post burst, could only be identified by 8-m class IR
observations, and suggests that such observations of all
optically dark bursts may be necessary to significantly enhance
the number of high-redshift GRBs known.},
