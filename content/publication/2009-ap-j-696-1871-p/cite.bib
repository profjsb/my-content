 abstract = {We report on observations of GRB 080503, a short gamma-ray burst (GRB)
with very bright extended emission (about 30 times the gamma-ray
fluence of the initial spike) in conjunction with a thorough
comparison to other short Swift events. In spite of the prompt-
emission brightness, however, the optical counterpart is
extraordinarily faint, never exceeding 25 mag in deep
observations starting at åisebox-0.5ex~1 hr
after the Burst Alert Telescope (BAT) trigger. The optical
brightness peaks at \i̊sebox-0.5ex~1 day and
then falls sharply in a manner similar to the predictions of Li
&amp; Paczy\ŉski (1998) for supernova-like emission
following compact binary mergers. However, a shallow spectral
index and similar evolution in X-rays inferred from Chandra
observations are more consistent with an afterglow
interpretation. The extreme faintness of this probable afterglow
relative to the bright gamma-ray emission argues for a very low
density medium surrounding the burst (a ``naked'' GRB),
consistent with the lack of a coincident host galaxy down to
28.5 mag in deep Hubble Space Telescope imaging. The late
optical and X-ray peak could be explained by a slightly off-axis
jet or by a refreshed shock. Our observations reinforce the
notion that short GRBs generally occur outside regions of active
star formation, but demonstrate that in some cases the
luminosity of the extended prompt emission can greatly exceed
that of the short spike, which may constrain theoretical
interpretation of this class of events. This extended emission
is not the onset of an afterglow, and its relative brightness is
probably either a viewing-angle effect or intrinsic to the
central engine itself. Because most previous BAT short bursts
without observed extended emission are too faint for this
signature to have been detectable even if it were present at
typical level, conclusions based solely on the observed presence
or absence of extended emission in the existing Swift sample are
premature.},
