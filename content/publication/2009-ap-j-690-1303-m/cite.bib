 abstract = {We report on our early photometric and spectroscopic observations of the
extremely luminous Type II supernova (SN) 2008es. SN 2008es,
with an observed peak optical magnitude of m$_V$ = 17.8 and at
a redshift z = 0.213, has a peak absolute magnitude of M$_V$ =
-22.3, making it the second most luminous SN ever observed. The
photometric evolution of SN 2008es exhibits a fast decline rate
(Ã¥isebox-0.5ex~ 0.042 mag d$^-1$), similar
to the extremely luminous Type II-Linear (II-L) SN 2005ap. We
show that SN 2008es spectroscopically resembles the luminous
Type II-L SN 1979C. Although the spectra of SN 2008es lack the
narrow and intermediate-width line emission typically associated
with the interaction of an SN with the circumstellar medium of
its progenitor star, we argue that the extreme luminosity of SN
2008es is powered via strong interaction with a dense, optically
thick circumstellar medium. The integrated bolometric luminosity
of SN 2008es yields a total radiated energy at ultraviolet and
optical wavelengths of gsim 10$^51$ erg. Finally, we examine
the apparently anomalous rate at which the Texas Supernova
Search has discovered rare kinds of SNe, including the five most
luminous SNe observed to date, and find that their results are
consistent with those of other modern SN searches.},
