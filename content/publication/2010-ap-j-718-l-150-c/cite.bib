 abstract = {We report SMARTS, Gemini, and Swift-UVOT observations of the optical
transient (OT) associated with gamma-ray burst (GRB) 091127, at
redshift 0.49, taken between 0.9 hr and 102 days following the
Swift trigger. In our early-time observations, the OT fades in a
manner consistent with previously observed GRB afterglows.
However, after nine days post-burst, the OT is observed to
brighten for a period of åisebox-0.5ex~two
weeks, after which the source resumes fading. A comparison of
this late-time ``bump'' to SN 1998bw (the broad-lined Type Ic
supernova associated with GRB 980425), and several other GRB
supernovae (SNe), indicates that the most straightforward
explanation is that GRB 091127 was accompanied by a
contemporaneous SN (SN 2009nz) that peaked at a magnitude of
M$_V$ = -19.0 \ensuremath± 0.2. SN 2009nz is globally
similar to other GRB SNe, but evolves slightly faster than SN
1998bw and reaches a slightly dimmer peak magnitude. We also
analyze the early-time UV-optical-IR spectral energy
distribution of the afterglow of GRB 091127 and find that there
is little to no reddening in the host galaxy along the line of
sight to this burst.},
