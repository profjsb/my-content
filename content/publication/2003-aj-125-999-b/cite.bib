 abstract = {Using the Echellete Spectrograph Imager (ESI) on the Keck II 10 m
telescope we have measured the redshifts of the host galaxies of
gamma-ray bursts GRB 990506 and GRB 000418, z=1.30658+/-0.00004
and 1.1181+/-0.0001, respectively. Thanks to the excellent
spectral resolution of ESI (\ensuremathłambda/\ensuremath
Δ\ensuremathłambda=13000), we resolved the [O II]
\ensuremathłambda3727 doublet in both cases. The measured
redshift of GRB 990506 is the highest known for a dark-burst
GRB, though entirely consistent with the notion that dark and
non-dark bursts have a common progenitor origin. The relative
strengths of the [O II], He I, [Ne III], and
H\ensuremathγ emission lines suggest that the host of
GRB 000418 is a starburst galaxy, rather than a LINER or Seyfert
2. Since the host of GRB 000418 has been detected at
submillimeter wavelengths, these spectroscopic observations
suggest that the submillimeter emission is due to star formation
(as opposed to AGN) activity. The [O II]-derived unobscured star
formation rates are 13 and 55 M$_solar$ yr$^-1$ for the
hosts of GRB 990506 and GRB 000418, respectively. In contrast,
the star formation rate of the host of GRB 000418 derived from
submillimeter observations is 20 times larger.},
