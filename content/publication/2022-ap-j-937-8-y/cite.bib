 abstract = {We present X-ray, UV, optical, and radio observations of the nearby
(\ensuremath≈78 Mpc) tidal disruption event
AT2021ehb/ZTF21aanxhjv during its first 430 days of evolution.
AT2021ehb occurs in the nucleus of a galaxy hosting
a\ensuremath≈10$^7$ M $_\ensuremathødot$
black hole (M $_BH$ inferred from host galaxy scaling
relations). High-cadence Swift and Neutron Star Interior
Composition Explorer (NICER) monitoring reveals a delayed X-ray
brightening. The spectrum first undergoes a gradual soft
\textrightarrow hard transition and then suddenly turns soft
again within 3 days at \ensuremathδ
t\ensuremath≈272 days during which the X-ray flux
drops by a factor of 10. In the joint NICER+NuSTAR observation
(\ensuremathδ t = 264 days, harder state), we observe a
prominent nonthermal component up to 30 keV and an extremely
broad emission line in the iron K band. The bolometric
luminosity of AT2021ehb reaches a maximum of
$6.0_-3.8^+10.4 % L_\mathrmEdd$ when the X-ray
spectrum is the hardest. During the dramatic X-ray evolution, no
radio emission is detected, the UV/optical luminosity stays
relatively constant, and the optical spectra are featureless. We
propose the following interpretations: (i) the soft
\textrightarrow hard transition may be caused by the gradual
formation of a magnetically dominated corona; (ii) hard X-ray
photons escape from the system along solid angles with low
scattering optical depth (åisebox-0.5ex~a few)
whereas the UV/optical emission is likely generated by
reprocessing materials with much larger column density-the
system is highly aspherical; and (iii) the abrupt X-ray flux
drop may be triggered by the thermal-viscous instability in the
inner accretion flow, leading to a much thinner disk.},
