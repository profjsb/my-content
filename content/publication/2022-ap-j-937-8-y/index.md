abstract: 'We present X-ray, UV, optical, and radio observations of the nearby (≈78
  Mpc) tidal disruption event AT2021ehb/ZTF21aanxhjv during its first 430 days of
  evolution. AT2021ehb occurs in the nucleus of a galaxy hosting a≈10$^7$
  M $_ødot$ black hole (M $_BH$ inferred from host galaxy scaling relations).
  High-cadence Swift and Neutron Star Interior Composition Explorer (NICER) monitoring
  reveals a delayed X-ray brightening. The spectrum first undergoes a gradual soft
  textrightarrow hard transition and then suddenly turns soft again within 3 days
  at δ t≈272 days during which the X-ray flux drops by a factor
  of 10. In the joint NICER+NuSTAR observation (δ t = 264 days, harder state),
  we observe a prominent nonthermal component up to 30 keV and an extremely broad
  emission line in the iron K band. The bolometric luminosity of AT2021ehb reaches
  a maximum of $6.0_-3.8^+10.4 % L_mathrmEdd$ when the X-ray spectrum is the hardest.
  During the dramatic X-ray evolution, no radio emission is detected, the UV/optical
  luminosity stays relatively constant, and the optical spectra are featureless. We
  propose the following interpretations: (i) the soft textrightarrow hard transition
  may be caused by the gradual formation of a magnetically dominated corona; (ii)
  hard X-ray photons escape from the system along solid angles with low scattering
  optical depth (åisebox-0.5ex a few) whereas the UV/optical emission is likely generated
  by reprocessing materials with much larger column density-the system is highly aspherical;
  and (iii) the abrupt X-ray flux drop may be triggered by the thermal-viscous instability
  in the inner accretion flow, leading to a much thinner disk.'
