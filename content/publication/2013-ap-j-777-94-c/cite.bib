 abstract = {We present early optical photometry and spectroscopy of the afterglow
and host galaxy of the bright short-duration gamma-ray burst GRB
130603B discovered by the Swift satellite. Using our Target of
Opportunity program on the Gemini South telescope, our prompt
optical spectra reveal a strong trace from the afterglow
superimposed on continuum and emission lines from the z = 0.3568
\ensuremath± 0.0005 host galaxy. The combination of a
relatively bright optical afterglow (r' = 21.52 at
\ensuremathΔt = 8.4 hr), together with an observed
offset of 0.``9 from the host nucleus (4.8 kpc projected
distance at z = 0.3568), allow us to extract a relatively clean
spectrum dominated by afterglow light. Furthermore, the
spatially resolved spectrum allows us to constrain the
properties of the explosion site directly, and compare these
with the host galaxy nucleus, as well as other short-duration
GRB host galaxies. We find that while the host is a relatively
luminous (L ≈ 0.8
\,L\̂*\_\B\), star-forming (SFR = 1.84 M
$_☉$ yr$^-1$) galaxy with almost solar metallicity, the
spectrum of the afterglow exhibits weak Ca II absorption
features but negligible emission features. The explosion site
therefore lacks evidence of recent star formation, consistent
with the relatively long delay time distribution expected in a
compact binary merger scenario. The star formation rate (SFR;
both in an absolute sense and normalized to the luminosity) and
metallicity of the host are both consistent with the known
sample of short-duration GRB hosts and with recent results which
suggest GRB 130603B emission to be the product of the decay of
radioactive species produced during the merging process of a
neutron-star-neutron-star binary (''kilonova''). Ultimately, the
discovery of more events similar to GRB 130603B and their rapid
follow-up from 8 m class telescopes will open new opportunities
for our understanding of the final stages of compact-objects
binary systems and provide crucial information (redshift,
metallicity, and chemical content of their explosion site) to
characterize the environment of one of the most promising
gravitational wave sources.},
