 abstract = {R. J. Foley, D. Perley, J. S. Bloom, University of California, Berkeley;
and J. X. Prochaska, University of California, Santa Cruz,
report that inspection of CCD spectra (range 390-1000 nm),
obtained on Aug. 4.34 UT with the Keck II 10-m telescope (+
ESI), shows that SN 2005de (cf. IAUC 8580) is of type Ia,
resembling SN 1992A (Kirshner et al. 1993, Ap.J. 415, 589) at a
few days before maximum brightness. Adopting a redshift of 4481
km/s (from Na D absorption lines in the spectrum), the expansion
velocity of Si II (rest 635.5 nm) is about 13300 km/s.},
