 abstract = {A body in solar orbit beyond the Kuiper Belt exhibits an annual parallax
that exceeds its apparent proper motion by up to many orders of
magnitude. Apparent motion of this body along the parallactic
ellipse will deflect the angular position of background stars
due to astrometric microlensing (``induced parallax``). By
synoptically sampling the astrometric position of background
stars over the entire sky, constraints on the existence (and
basic properties) of a massive nearby body may be inferred. With
a simple simulation, we estimate the signal-to-noise ratio for
detecting such a body-as a function of mass, heliocentric
distance, and ecliptic latitude-using the anticipated
sensitivity and temporal cadences from Gaia (launch date 2011).
A Jupiter-mass (M$_J$) object at 2000 AU is detectable by Gaia
over the whole sky above 5 \ensuremathσ, with even
stronger constraints if it lies near the ecliptic plane.
Hypotheses for the mass
(åisebox-0.5ex~3M$_J$), distance
(\i̊sebox-0.5ex~20,000 AU), and location of the
proposed perturber (``Planet X''), which gives rise to long-
period comets, may be testable.},
