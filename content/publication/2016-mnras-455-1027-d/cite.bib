 abstract = {Gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) are the most luminous explosions in the
Universe, yet the nature and physical properties of their energy
sources are far from understood. Very important clues, however,
can be inferred by studying the afterglows of these events. We
present optical and X-ray observations of GRB 130831A obtained
by Swift, Chandra, Skynet, Reionization And Transients Infra-Red
camera, Maidanak, International Scientific Optical-Observation
Network, Nordic Optical Telescope, Liverpool Telescope and Gran
Telescopio Canarias. This burst shows a steep drop in the X-ray
light curve at ≃10$^5$ s after the trigger, with a power-law
decay index of \ensuremathα ̃ 6. Such a rare behaviour
cannot be explained by the standard forward shock (FS) model and
indicates that the emission, up to the fast decay at 10$^5$
s, must be of `internal origin', produced by a dissipation
process within an ultrarelativistic outflow. We propose that the
source of such an outflow, which must produce the X-ray flux for
≃1 d in the cosmological rest frame, is a newly born magnetar or
black hole. After the drop, the faint X-ray afterglow continues
with a much shallower decay. The optical emission, on the other
hand, shows no break across the X-ray steep decrease, and the
late-time decays of both the X-ray and optical are consistent.
Using both the X-ray and optical data, we show that the emission
after ≃10$^5$ s can be explained well by the FS model. We
model our data to derive the kinetic energy of the ejecta and
thus measure the efficiency of the central engine of a GRB with
emission of internal origin visible for a long time.
Furthermore, we break down the energy budget of this GRB into
the prompt emission, the late internal dissipation, the kinetic
energy of the relativistic ejecta, and compare it with the
energy of the associated supernova, SN 2013 fu.},
