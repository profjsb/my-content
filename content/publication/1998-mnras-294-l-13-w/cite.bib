 abstract = {A gamma-ray burst (GRB) releases an amount of energy similar to that of
a supernova explosion, which combined with its rapid variability
suggests an origin related to neutron stars or black holes.
Since these compact stellar remnants form from the most massive
stars not long after their birth, GRBs should trace the star
formation rate in the Universe; we show that the GRB flux
distribution is consistent with this. Because of the strong
evolution of the star formation rate with redshift, it follows
that the dimmest known bursts have
zåisebox-0.5ex~6, much above the value usually
quoted and beyond the most distant quasars. This explains the
absence of bright galaxies in well-studied GRB error boxes. The
increased distances imply a peak luminosity of
8.3x105̂1ergs\1̂ and a rate density of 0.025 per million years
per galaxy. These values are 20 times higher and 150 times
lower, respectively, than are implied by fits with non-evolving
GRB rates. This means either that GRBs are caused by a much
rarer phenomenon than mergers of binary neutron stars, or that
their gamma-ray emission is often invisible to us due to
beaming. Precise burst locations from optical transients will
discriminate between the various models for GRBs from stellar
deaths, because the distance between progenitor birth place and
burst varies greatly among them. The dimmest GRBs are then the
most distant known objects, and may probe the Universe at an age
when the first stars were forming.},
