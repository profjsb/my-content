 abstract = {Tidal disruption events (TDEs) are bursts of electromagnetic energy that
are released when supermassive black holes at the centres of
galaxies violently disrupt a star that passes too close$^1$.
TDEs provide a window through which to study accretion onto
supermassive black holes; in some rare cases, this accretion
leads to launching of a relativistic jet$^2-9$, but the
necessary conditions are not fully understood. The best-studied
jetted TDE so far is Swift J1644+57, which was discovered in
\ensuremathγ-rays, but was too obscured by dust to be
seen at optical wavelengths. Here we report the optical
detection of AT2022cmc, a rapidly fading source at cosmological
distance (redshift z = 1.19325) the unique light curve of which
transitioned into a luminous plateau within days. Observations
of a bright counterpart at other wavelengths, including X-ray,
submillimetre and radio, supports the interpretation of
AT2022cmc as a jetted TDE containing a synchrotron `afterglow',
probably launched by a supermassive black hole with spin greater
than approximately 0.3. Using four years of Zwicky Transient
Facility$^10$ survey data, we calculate a rate of 0.0
2$_\ensuremath-0.01$$^+0.04$ Gpc$^\ensuremath-3$
yr$^\ensuremath-1$ for on-axis jetted TDEs on the basis of
the luminous, fast-fading red component, thus providing a
measurement complementary to the rates derived from X-ray and
radio observations$^11$. Correcting for the beaming angle
effects, this rate confirms that approximately 1 per cent of
TDEs have relativistic jets. Optical surveys can use AT2022cmc
as a prototype to unveil a population of jetted TDEs.},
