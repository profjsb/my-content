abstract: Tidal disruption events (TDEs) are bursts of electromagnetic energy that
  are released when supermassive black holes at the centres of galaxies violently
  disrupt a star that passes too close$^1$. TDEs provide a window through which to
  study accretion onto supermassive black holes; in some rare cases, this accretion
  leads to launching of a relativistic jet$^2-9$, but the necessary conditions are
  not fully understood. The best-studied jetted TDE so far is Swift J1644+57, which
  was discovered in γ-rays, but was too obscured by dust to be seen at optical
  wavelengths. Here we report the optical detection of AT2022cmc, a rapidly fading
  source at cosmological distance (redshift z = 1.19325) the unique light curve of
  which transitioned into a luminous plateau within days. Observations of a bright
  counterpart at other wavelengths, including X-ray, submillimetre and radio, supports
  the interpretation of AT2022cmc as a jetted TDE containing a synchrotron `afterglow',
  probably launched by a supermassive black hole with spin greater than approximately
  0.3. Using four years of Zwicky Transient Facility$^10$ survey data, we calculate
  a rate of 0.0 2$_-0.01$$^+0.04$ Gpc$^-3$ yr$^-1$ for
  on-axis jetted TDEs on the basis of the luminous, fast-fading red component, thus
  providing a measurement complementary to the rates derived from X-ray and radio
  observations$^11$. Correcting for the beaming angle effects, this rate confirms
  that approximately 1 per cent of TDEs have relativistic jets. Optical surveys can
  use AT2022cmc as a prototype to unveil a population of jetted TDEs.
