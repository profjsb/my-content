 abstract = {We present three new eclipsing white-dwarf/M-dwarf binary systems
discovered during a search for transiting planets around
M-dwarfs. Unlike most known eclipsing systems of this type, the
optical and infrared emission is dominated by the M-dwarf
components, and the systems have optical colors and discovery
light curves consistent with being Jupiter-radius transiting
planets around early M-dwarfs. We detail the PTF/M-dwarf
transiting planet survey, part of the Palomar Transient Factory
(PTF). We present a graphics processing unit (GPU)-based box-
least-squares search for transits that runs approximately 8
× faster than similar algorithms implemented on
general purpose systems. For the discovered systems, we
decompose low-resolution spectra of the systems into white-dwarf
and M-dwarf components, and use radial velocity measurements and
cooling models to estimate masses and radii for the white
dwarfs. The systems are compact, with periods between 0.35 and
0.45 days and semimajor axes of approximately 2 R $_☉$ (0.01
AU). The M-dwarfs have masses of approximately 0.35 M $_☉$,
and the white dwarfs have hydrogen-rich atmospheres with
temperatures of around 8000 K and have masses of approximately
0.5 M $_☉$. We use the Robo-AO laser guide star adaptive
optics system to tentatively identify one of the objects as a
triple system. We also use high-cadence photometry to put an
upper limit on the white-dwarf radius of 0.025 R $_☉$ (95%
confidence) in one of the systems. Accounting for our detection
efficiency and geometric factors, we estimate that
0.08%\̂+0.10%\_\-0.05%\ (90% confidence) of M-dwarfs
are in these short-period, post-common-envelope white-
dwarf/M-dwarf binaries where the optical light is dominated by
the M-dwarf. The lack of detections at shorter periods, despite
near-100% detection efficiency for such systems, suggests that
binaries including these relatively low-temperature white dwarfs
are preferentially found at relatively large orbital radii.
Similar eclipsing binary systems can have arbitrarily small
eclipse depths in red bands and generate plausible small-planet-
transit light curves. As such, these systems are a source of
false positives for M-dwarf transiting planet searches. We
present several ways to rapidly distinguish these binaries from
transiting planet systems.},
