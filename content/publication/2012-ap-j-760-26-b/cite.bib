 abstract = {We present near- and mid-infrared photometry and spectroscopy from
PAIRITEL, IRTF, and Spitzer of a metallicity-unbiased sample of
117 cool, hydrogen-atmosphere white dwarfs (WDs) from the
Palomar-Green survey and find five with excess radiation in the
infrared, translating to a 4.3$^+2.7$ $_- 1.2$% frequency
of debris disks. This is slightly higher than, but consistent
with the results of previous surveys. Using an initial-final
mass relation, we apply this result to the progenitor stars of
our sample and conclude that 1-7 M $_☉$ stars have at least a
4.3% chance of hosting planets; an indirect probe of the
intermediate-mass regime eluding conventional exoplanetary
detection methods. Alternatively, we interpret this result as a
limit on accretion timescales as a fraction of WD cooling ages;
WDs accrete debris from several generations of disks for
åisebox-0.5ex~10 Myr. The average total mass
accreted by these stars ranges from that of 200 km asteroids to
Ceres-sized objects, indicating that WDs accrete moons and dwarf
planets as well as solar system asteroid analogs.},
