 abstract = {Owing to its extremely high luminosity and long duration, supernova (SN)
2006gy radiated more energy in visual light than any other known
SN. Two hypotheses to explain its high luminosity at early
times—that it was powered by shock interaction with
circumstellar material (CSM) as implied by its Type IIn
spectrum, or that it was fueled by radioactive decay from a
large mass of $^56$Ni synthesized in a pair-instability
SN—predicted different late-time properties. Here we
present observations of SN 2006gy obtained more than a year
after discovery. We were unable to detect it at visual
wavelengths, but clear near-infrared (IR) K$^′$ and H-band
detections show that it is still at least as luminous as the
peak of a normal Type II SN. We also present spectra giving an
upper limit to the late-time H\ensuremathα luminosity
of lesssim10$^39$ erg s$^-1$. Based on the weak late-time
H\ensuremathα, X-ray, and radio emission, combined with
the difficulty of explaining the shift to IR wavelengths, we can
rule out ongoing CSM interaction as the primary late-time power
source of SN 2006gy. Instead, we propose that the evolution of
SN 2006gy is consistent with one of two possible scenarios: (1)
a pair-instability SN plus modest CSM interaction, where the
radioactive decay luminosity shifts to the IR because of dust
formation; or (2) an IR echo, where radiation emitted during
peak luminosity heats a pre-existing dust shell at radii near 1
light year, requiring the progenitor star to have ejected
another shell of åisebox-0.5ex~10 M$_☉$
about 1500 yr before the SN.},
