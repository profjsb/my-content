 abstract = {We present near- and mid-infrared photometry and spectroscopy from
PAIRITEL, IRTF, and Spitzer of a metallicity-unbiased sample of
117 cool, hydrogen-atmosphere white dwarfs from the Palomar-
Green survey and find five with excess radiation in the
infrared, translating to a 4.3$_-1.2$$^+2.2$ % frequency of
debris disks. This is slightly higher than, but consistent with
the results of previous surveys. Using an initial-final mass
relation, we apply this result to the progenitor stars of our
sample and conclude that 1-7M$_☉$ stars have at least a 4.3%
chance of hosting planets; an indirect probe of the
intermediate-mass regime eluding conventional exoplanetary
detection methods. Alternatively, we interpret this result as a
limit on accretion timescales as a fraction of white dwarf
cooling ages; white dwarfs accrete debris from several
generations of disks for ̃10Myr. The average total mass accreted
by these stars ranges from that of 200km asteroids to Ceres-
sized objects, indicating that white dwarfs accrete moons and
dwarf planets as well as Solar System asteroid analogues. <P />},
