 abstract = {The Palomar Transient Factory (PTF) Orion project is one of the
experiments within the broader PTF survey, a systematic
automated exploration of the sky for optical transients. Taking
advantage of the wide (3fdg5 × 2fdg3) field of view
available using the PTF camera installed at the Palomar 48 inch
telescope, 40 nights were dedicated in 2009 December to 2010
January to perform continuous high-cadence differential
photometry on a single field containing the young (7-10 Myr) 25
Ori association. Little is known empirically about the formation
of planets at these young ages, and the primary motivation for
the project is to search for planets around young stars in this
region. The unique data set also provides for much ancillary
science. In this first paper, we describe the survey and the
data reduction pipeline, and present some initial results from
an inspection of the most clearly varying stars relating to two
of the ancillary science objectives: detection of eclipsing
binaries and young stellar objects. We find 82 new eclipsing
binary systems, 9 of which are good candidate 25 Ori or Orion
OB1a association members. Of these, two are potential young W
UMa type systems. We report on the possible low-mass (M-dwarf
primary) eclipsing systems in the sample, which include six of
the candidate young systems. Forty-five of the binary systems
are close (mainly contact) systems, and one of these shows an
orbital period among the shortest known for W UMa binaries, at
0.2156509 \ensuremath± 0.0000071 days, with flat-bottomed
primary eclipses, and a derived distance that appears consistent
with membership in the general Orion association. One of the
candidate young systems presents an unusual light curve, perhaps
representing a semi-detached binary system with an inflated low-
mass primary or a star with a warped disk, and may represent an
additional young Orion member. Finally, we identify 14 probable
new classical T-Tauri stars in our data, along with one
previously known (CVSO 35) and one previously reported as a
candidate weak-line T-Tauri star (SDSS J052700.12+010136.8).},
