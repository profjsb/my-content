 abstract = {We present broadband (radio, optical, and X-ray) light curves and
spectra of the afterglows of four long-duration gamma-ray bursts
(GRBs GRBs 090323, 090328, 090902B, and 090926A) detected by the
Gamma-Ray Burst Monitor and Large Area Telescope (LAT)
instruments on the Fermi satellite. With its wide spectral
bandpass, extending to GeV energies, Fermi is sensitive to GRBs
with very large isotropic energy releases (10$^54$ erg).
Although rare, these events are particularly important for
testing GRB central-engine models. When combined with
spectroscopic redshifts, our afterglow data for these four
events are able to constrain jet collimation angles, the density
structure of the circumburst medium, and both the true radiated
energy release and the kinetic energy of the outflows. In
agreement with our earlier work, we find that the relativistic
energy budget of at least one of these events (GRB 090926A)
exceeds the canonical value of 10$^51$ erg by an order of
magnitude. Such energies pose a severe challenge for models in
which the GRB is powered by a magnetar or a neutrino-driven
collapsar, but remain compatible with theoretical expectations
for magnetohydrodynamical collapsar models (e.g., the Blandford-
Znajek mechanism). Our jet opening angles
(\ensuremathþeta) are similar to those found for pre-Fermi
GRBs, but the large initial Lorentz factors
(\ensuremathΓ$_0$) inferred from the detection of GeV
photons imply \ensuremathþeta\ensuremathΓ$_0$
\ensuremath≈ 70-90, values which are above those
predicted in magnetohydrodynamic models of jet acceleration.
Finally, we find that these Fermi-LAT events preferentially
occur in a low-density circumburst environment, and we speculate
that this might result from the lower mass-loss rates of their
lower-metallicity progenitor stars. Future studies of Fermi-LAT
afterglows at radio wavelengths with the order-of-magnitude
improvement in sensitivity offered by the Extended Very Large
Array should definitively establish the relativistic energy
budgets of these events.},
