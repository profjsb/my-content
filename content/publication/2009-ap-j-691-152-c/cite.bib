 abstract = {We present a study of 15 long-duration \ensuremathγ-ray burst
(GRB) host galaxies at z &gt; 2. The GRBs are selected with
available early-time afterglow spectra in order to compare
interstellar medium (ISM) absorption-line properties with
stellar properties of the host galaxies. In addition to five
previously studied hosts, we consider new detections for the
host galaxies of GRB 050820 and GRB 060206, and place
2\ensuremathσ upper limits to the luminosities of the
remaining unidentified hosts. We examine the nature of the host
galaxy population and find that (1) the UV luminosity
distribution of GRB host galaxies is consistent with
expectations from a UV luminosity weighted random galaxy
population with a median luminosity of langL(UV)rang = 0.1 L
$_*$, (2) there exists a moderate correlation between UV
luminosity and Si II \ensuremathłambda 1526 absorption
width, which together with the observed large line widths of
W(1526)&gt;1.5 ̊A for a large fraction of the objects
suggests a galactic outflow driven velocity field in the host
galaxies, (3) there is tentative evidence for a trend of
declining ISM metallicity with decreasing galaxy luminosity in
the star-forming galaxy population at z = 2-4, (4) the
interstellar UV radiation field is found to be
35-350× higher in GRB hosts than the Galactic mean
value, and (5) additional galaxies are found at lsim2`` from the
GRB host in all fields with known presence of strong Mg II
absorbers, but no additional faint galaxies are found at lsim2''
in fields without strong Mg II absorbers. Our study confirms
that the GRB host galaxies (with known optical afterglows) are
representative of unobscured star-forming galaxies at z &gt; 2,
and demonstrates that high spatial resolution images are
necessary for an accurate identification of GRB host galaxies in
the presence of strong intervening absorbers. <P />Observations
reported here were obtained in part at the Magellan telescopes,

Institution of Washington, University of Arizona, Harvard
