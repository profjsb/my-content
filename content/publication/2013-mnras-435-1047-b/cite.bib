 abstract = {Modern time-domain surveys continuously monitor large swaths of the sky
to look for astronomical variability. Astrophysical discovery in
such data sets is complicated by the fact that detections of
real transient and variable sources are highly outnumbered by
`bogus' detections caused by imperfect subtractions, atmospheric
effects and detector artefacts. In this work, we present a
machine-learning (ML) framework for discovery of variability in
time-domain imaging surveys. Our ML methods provide
probabilistic statements, in near real time, about the degree to
which each newly observed source is an astrophysically relevant
source of variable brightness. We provide details about each of
the analysis steps involved, including compilation of the
training and testing sets, construction of descriptive image-
based and contextual features, and optimization of the feature
subset and model tuning parameters. Using a validation set of
nearly 30 000 objects from the Palomar Transient Factory, we
demonstrate a missed detection rate of at most 7.7 per cent at
our chosen false-positive rate of 1 per cent for an optimized ML
classifier of 23 features, selected to avoid feature correlation
and overfitting from an initial library of 42 attributes.
Importantly, we show that our classification methodology is
insensitive to mislabelled training data up to a contamination
of nearly 10 per cent, making it easier to compile sufficient
training sets for accurate performance in future surveys. This
ML framework, if so adopted, should enable the maximization of
scientific gain from future synoptic survey and enable fast
follow-up decisions on the vast amounts of streaming data
produced by such experiments.},
