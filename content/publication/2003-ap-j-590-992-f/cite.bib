 abstract = {We present radio observations of the afterglow of the bright gamma-ray
burst GRB 980703 made between 1 day and 1 yr after the burst.
These data are combined with published late-time radio
measurements and existing optical, near-infrared, and X-ray
observations to create a comprehensive broadband data set for
modeling the physical parameters of the outflow. While a wind-
stratified medium cannot be ruled out statistically, it requires
a high fraction of the shock energy in the electrons and so is
not favored on theoretical grounds. Instead, the data are
consistent with a fireball model in which the ejecta are
collimated and expanding into a constant-density medium. The
radio data cannot be fitted with an isotropic shock but instead
require a jet break at åisebox-0.5ex~3.5 days,
not seen at optical wavelengths because of the presence of a
bright host galaxy. The addition of the full radio data set
constrains the self-absorption frequency, giving an estimate of
the circumburst density of n\i̊sebox-0.5ex~30
cm$^-3$, a value that differs substantially from previous
estimates. This result is consistent with the growing number of
GRB afterglows, for which broadband modeling yields
n\rs̊ebox-0.5ex~=0.1-100 cm$^-3$, with a
typical value of \rae̊box-0.5ex~10 cm$^-3$.},
