 abstract = {Only a handful of supernovae (SNe) have been studied in multiwavelengths
from the radio to X-rays, starting a few days after the
explosion. The early detection and classification of the nearby
Type IIb SN 2011dh/PTF 11eon in M51 provides a unique
opportunity to conduct such observations. We present detailed
data obtained at one of the youngest phase ever of a core-
collapse SN (days 3-12 after the explosion) in the radio,
millimetre and X-rays; when combined with optical data, this
allows us to explore the early evolution of the SN blast wave
and its surroundings. Our analysis shows that the expanding SN
shock wave does not exhibit equipartition
(\ensuremathın$_e$/\ensuremathın$_B$ ̃ 1000), and
is expanding into circumstellar material that is consistent with
a density profile falling like R$^-2$. Within modelling
uncertainties we find an average velocity of the fast parts of
the ejecta of 15 000 \ensuremath± 1800 km s$^-1$,
contrary to previous analysis. This velocity places SN 2011dh in
an intermediate blast wave regime between the previously defined
compact and extended SN Type IIb subtypes. Our results highlight
the importance of early (̃1 d) high-frequency observations of
future events. Moreover, we show the importance of combined
radio/X-ray observations for determining the microphysics ratio
\ensuremathın$_e$/\ensuremathın$_B$.},
