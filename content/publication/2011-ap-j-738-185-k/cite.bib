 abstract = {Interstellar dust presents a significant challenge to extending
parallax-determined distances of optically observed pulsational
variables to larger volumes. Distance ladder work at mid-
infrared wavebands, where dust effects are negligible and
metallicity correlations are minimized, has been largely focused
on few-epoch Cepheid studies. Here we present the first
determination of mid-infrared period-luminosity (PL) relations
of RR Lyrae stars from phase-resolved imaging using the
preliminary data release of the Wide-field Infrared Survey
Explorer (WISE). We present a novel statistical framework to
predict posterior distances of 76 well observed RR Lyrae that
uses the optically constructed prior distance moduli while
simultaneously imposing a power-law PL relation to WISE-
determined mean magnitudes. We find that the absolute magnitude
in the bluest WISE filter is M $_W1$ = (- 0.421
\ensuremath± 0.014) - (1.681 \ensuremath±
0.147)log$_10$(P/0.50118 day), with no evidence for a
correlation with metallicity. Combining the results from the
three bluest WISE filters, we find that a typical star in our
sample has a distance measurement uncertainty of 0.97%
(statistical) plus 1.17% (systematic). We do not fundamentalize
the periods of RRc stars to improve their fit to the relations.
Taking the Hipparcos-derived mean V-band magnitudes, we use the
distance posteriors to determine a new optical metallicity-
luminosity relation. The results of this analysis will soon be
tested by Hubble Space Telescope parallax measurements and,
eventually, with the GAIA astrometric mission.},
