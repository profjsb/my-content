 abstract = {We present multicolor optical and two-frequency radio observations of
the bright BeppoSAX event GRB 990510. Neither the well-sampled
optical decay nor the radio observations are consistent with
simple spherical afterglow models. The achromatic steepening in
the optical band and the early decay of the radio afterglow,
which both occur at tåisebox-0.5ex~1 day, are
evidence for hydrodynamical evolution of the source and can be
most easily interpreted by models in which the gamma-ray burst
ejecta are collimated in a jet. Employing a simple jet model to
explain the observations, we derive a jet opening angle of
\ensuremathþeta$_0$=0.08(n/1 cm$^-3$)$^1/8$,
reducing the isotropic gamma-ray energy release of
2.9×10$^53$ ergs by a factor of
\i̊sebox-0.5ex~300.},
