abstract: The Ultraviolet Explorer (UVEX) will undertake a synoptic survey of the
  entire sky in near-UV (NUV) and far-UV (FUV) bands, probing the dynamic FUV and
  NUV universe, as well as perform a modern, all- sky imaging survey that reaches
  >50 times deeper than GALEX. Combined with a powerful broadband spectroscopic capability
  and timely response to target of opportunity discoveries, UVEX will address fundamental
  questions from the NASA Astrophysics Roadmap and the Astro2020 Decadal Survey, enabling
  unique and important studies across the breadth of astrophysics. Imaging and spectroscopic
  surveys with UVEX will probe key aspects of the evolution of galaxies by understanding
  how star formation and stellar evolution at low metallicities affect the growth
  and evolution of low-metallicity, low-mass galaxies in the local universe. Such
  galaxies contain half the mass in the local universe, and are analogs for the first
  galaxies, but observed at distances that make them accessible to detailed study.
  The UVEX time-domain surveys and prompt spectroscopic follow-up capability will
  probe the environments, energetics, and emission processes in the early aftermaths
  of gravitational wave- discovered compact object mergers, discover hot, fast UV
  transients, and diagnose the early stages of explosive phenomena. UVEX will become
  a key community resource by filling a gap in the new generation of wide-field, sensitive
  optical and infrared surveys provided by the Rubin, Euclid, and Roman observatories.
  We discuss the scientific potential of UVEX, including unique studies UVEX will
  enable for studying exoplanet atmospheres, hot stars, explosive phenomena, black
  holes, and galaxy evolution.
