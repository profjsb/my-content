 abstract = {The Ultraviolet Explorer (UVEX) will undertake a synoptic survey of the
entire sky in near-UV (NUV) and far-UV (FUV) bands, probing the
dynamic FUV and NUV universe, as well as perform a modern, all-
sky imaging survey that reaches >50 times deeper than GALEX.
Combined with a powerful broadband spectroscopic capability and
timely response to target of opportunity discoveries, UVEX will
address fundamental questions from the NASA Astrophysics Roadmap
and the Astro2020 Decadal Survey, enabling unique and important
studies across the breadth of astrophysics. Imaging and
spectroscopic surveys with UVEX will probe key aspects of the
evolution of galaxies by understanding how star formation and
stellar evolution at low metallicities affect the growth and
evolution of low-metallicity, low-mass galaxies in the local
universe. Such galaxies contain half the mass in the local
universe, and are analogs for the first galaxies, but observed
at distances that make them accessible to detailed study. The
UVEX time-domain surveys and prompt spectroscopic follow-up
capability will probe the environments, energetics, and emission
processes in the early aftermaths of gravitational wave-
discovered compact object mergers, discover hot, fast UV
transients, and diagnose the early stages of explosive
phenomena. UVEX will become a key community resource by filling
a gap in the new generation of wide-field, sensitive optical and
infrared surveys provided by the Rubin, Euclid, and Roman
observatories. We discuss the scientific potential of UVEX,
including unique studies UVEX will enable for studying exoplanet
atmospheres, hot stars, explosive phenomena, black holes, and
galaxy evolution.},
