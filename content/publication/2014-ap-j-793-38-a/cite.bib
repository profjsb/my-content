 abstract = {We present the results of a Palomar Transient Factory (PTF) archival
search for blue transients that lie in the magnitude range
between ``normal'' core-collapse and superluminous supernovae
(i.e., with -21 &lt;= M $_ R (peak)$ &lt;= - 19). Of the six
events found after excluding all interacting Type IIn and Ia-CSM
supernovae, three (PTF09ge, 09axc, and 09djl) are coincident
with the centers of their hosts, one (10iam) is offset from the
center, and a precise offset cannot be determined for two (10nuj
and 11glr). All the central events have similar rise times to
the He-rich tidal disruption candidate PS1-10jh, and the event
with the best-sampled light curve also has similar colors and
power-law decay. Spectroscopically, PTF09ge is He-rich, while
PTF09axc and 09djl display broad hydrogen features around peak
magnitude. All three central events are in low star formation
hosts, two of which are E+A galaxies. Our spectrum of the host
of PS1-10jh displays similar properties. PTF10iam, the one
offset event, is different photometrically and spectroscopically
from the central events, and its host displays a higher star
formation rate. Finding no obvious evidence for ongoing galactic
nuclei activity or recent star formation, we conclude that the
three central transients likely arise from the tidal disruption
of a star by a supermassive black hole. We compare the spectra
of these events to tidal disruption candidates from the
literature and find that all of these objects can be unified on
a continuous scale of spectral properties. The accumulated
evidence of this expanded sample strongly supports a tidal
disruption origin for this class of nuclear transients.},
