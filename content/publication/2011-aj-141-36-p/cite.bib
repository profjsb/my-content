 abstract = {We present early-time optical through infrared photometry of the bright
Swift gamma-ray burst (GRB) 080607, starting only 6 s following
the initial trigger in the rest frame. Complemented by our
previously published spectroscopy, this high-quality photometric
data set allows us to solve for the extinction properties of the
redshift 3.036 sightline, giving perhaps the most detailed
information to date on the ultraviolet continuum absorption
properties of any sightline outside our Local Group. The
extinction properties are not adequately modeled by any ordinary
extinction template (including the average Milky Way, Large
Magellanic Cloud, and Small Magellanic Cloud curves), partially
because the 2175 ̊A feature (while present) is weaker by
about a factor of two than when seen under similar circumstances
locally. However, the spectral energy distribution is
exquisitely fitted by the more general Fitzpatrick &amp; Massa
parameterization of Local-Group extinction, putting it in the
same family as some peculiar Milky Way extinction curves. After
correcting for this (considerable, A$_V$ = 3.3
\ensuremath± 0.4 mag) extinction, GRB 080607 is revealed
to have been among the most optically luminous events ever
observed, comparable to the naked-eye burst GRB 080319B. Its
early peak time (t $_rest$ &lt; 6 s) indicates a high initial
Lorentz factor (\ensuremathΓ&gt;600), while the
extreme luminosity may be explained in part by a large
circumburst density. Only because of its early high luminosity
could the afterglow of GRB 080607 be studied in such detail in
spite of the large attenuation and great distance, making this
burst an excellent prototype for the understanding of other
highly obscured extragalactic objects, and of the class of
``dark'' GRBs in particular.},
