 abstract = {We report on the results of optical follow-up observations of the
counterpart of the gamma-ray burst GRB 970508, starting 7 hr
after the event. Multicolor U-, B-, V-, R$_c$-, and
I$_c$-band observations were obtained during the first three
consecutive nights. The counterpart was monitored regularly in
R$_c$ until åisebox-0.5ex~4 months after the
burst. The light curve after the maximum follows a decline that
can be fitted with a power law with exponent
\ensuremathα = -1.141 +/- 0.014. Deviations from a
smooth power-law decay are moderate (rms = 0.15 mag). We find no
flattening of the light curve at late times. The optical
afterglow fluence is a significant fraction,
\i̊sebox-0.5ex~5%, of the GRB fluence. The
optical energy distribution can be well represented by a power
law, the slope of which changed at the time of the maximum (the
spectrum became redder).},
