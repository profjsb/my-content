 abstract = {We report on strong H$_2$ and CO absorption from gas within the host
galaxy of gamma-ray burst (GRB) 080607. Analysis of our
Keck/LRIS afterglow spectrum reveals a very large H I column
density (N_H I = 10\̂22.70 \ensuremath± 0.15\
cm\-̂2\) and strong metal-line absorption at z $_GRB$ =
3.0363 with a roughly solar metallicity. We detect a series of A
- X bandheads from CO and estimate N(CO) =
10$^16.5\ensuremath±0.3$ cm$^-2$ and T $^CO$ $_ex$
&gt; 100 K. We argue that the high excitation temperature
results from UV pumping of the CO gas by the GRB afterglow.
Similarly, we observe H$_2$ absorption via the Lyman-Werner
bands and estimate N_H_2= 10\^1̂.2 \ensuremath± 0.2\
cm\^\\̂ with T_ex\^H_=̂ 10-300 K. The afterglow photometry
suggests an extinction law with R$_V$ \ensuremath≈ 4
and A$_V$ \ensuremath≈ 3.2 mag and requires the
presence of a modest 2175 ̊A bump. Additionally, modeling
of the Swift XRT X-ray spectrum confirms a large column density
with N $_H$ = 10$^22.58\ensuremath±0.04$ cm$^-2$.
Remarkably, this molecular gas has extinction properties,
metallicity, and a CO/H$_2$ ratio comparable to those of
translucent molecular clouds of the Milky Way, suggesting that
star formation at high z proceeds in similar environments as
today. However, the integrated dust-to-metals ratio is sub-
Galactic, suggesting the dust is primarily associated with the
molecular phase while the atomic gas has a much lower dust-to-
gas ratio. Sightlines like GRB 080607 serve as powerful probes
of nucleosynthesis and star-forming regions in the young
universe and contribute to the population of ``dark'' GRB
afterglows.},
