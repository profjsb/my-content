 abstract = {We present the discovery of PTF 10vgv, a Type Ic supernova (SN) detected
by the Palomar Transient Factory, using the Palomar 48 inch
telescope (P48). R-band observations of the PTF 10vgv field with
P48 probe the SN emission from its very early phases (about two
weeks before R-band maximum) and set limits on its flux in the
week prior to the discovery. Our sensitive upper limits and
early detections constrain the post-shock-breakout luminosity of
this event. Via comparison to numerical (analytical) models, we
derive an upper-limit of R &lt;åisebox-0.5ex~
4.5 R $_☉$ (R &lt;\i̊sebox-0.5ex~ 1 R
$_☉$) on the radius of the progenitor star, a direct
indication in favor of a compact Wolf-Rayet star. Applying a
similar analysis to the historical observations of SN 1994I
yields R &lt;\rs̊ebox-0.5ex~ 1/4 R $_☉$ for
the progenitor radius of this SN.},
