 abstract = {Context. SN 2020qlb (ZTF20abobpcb) is a hydrogen-poor superluminous
supernova (SLSN-I) that is among the most luminous (maximum
M$_g$ = \ensuremath-22.25 mag) and that has one of the
longest rise times (77 days from explosion to maximum). We
estimate the total radiated energy to be > 2.1 ×
10$^51$ erg. SN 2020qlb has a well-sampled light curve that
exhibits clear near and post peak undulations, a phenomenon seen
in other SLSNe, whose physical origin is still unknown.
\ Aims: We discuss the potential power source of
this immense explosion as well as the mechanisms behind its
observed light curve undulations. \ Methods: We
analyze photospheric spectra and compare them to other SLSNe-I.
We constructed the bolometric light curve using photometry from
a large data set of observations from the Zwicky Transient
Facility (ZTF), Liverpool Telescope (LT), and Neil Gehrels Swift
Observatory and compare it with radioactive, circumstellar
interaction and magnetar models. Model residuals and light curve
polynomial fit residuals are analyzed to estimate the undulation
timescale and amplitude. We also determine host galaxy
properties based on imaging and spectroscopy data, including a
detection of the [O III]\ensuremathłambda4363, auroral
line, allowing for a direct metallicity measurement.
\ Results: We rule out the Arnett $^56$Ni decay
model for SN 2020qlb's light curve due to unphysical parameter
results. Our most favored power source is the magnetic dipole
spin-down energy deposition of a magnetar. Two to three near
peak oscillations, intriguingly similar to those of SN 2015bn,
were found in the magnetar model residuals with a timescale of
32 \ensuremath± 6 days and an amplitude of 6% of peak
luminosity. We rule out centrally located undulation sources due
to timescale considerations; and we favor the result of ejecta
interactions with circumstellar material (CSM) density
fluctuations as the source of the undulations.},
