abstract: "Context. SN 2020qlb (ZTF20abobpcb) is a hydrogen-poor superluminous supernova\
  \ (SLSN-I) that is among the most luminous (maximum M$_g$ = -22.25 mag)\
  \ and that has one of the longest rise times (77 days from explosion to maximum).\
  \ We estimate the total radiated energy to be > 2.1 × 10$^51$ erg. SN 2020qlb has\
  \ a well-sampled light curve that exhibits clear near and post peak undulations,\
  \ a phenomenon seen in other SLSNe, whose physical origin is still unknown.  Aims:\
  \ We discuss the potential power source of this immense explosion as well as the\
  \ mechanisms behind its observed light curve undulations.  Methods: We analyze photospheric\
  \ spectra and compare them to other SLSNe-I. We constructed the bolometric light\
  \ curve using photometry from a large data set of observations from the Zwicky Transient\
  \ Facility (ZTF), Liverpool Telescope (LT), and Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory and\
  \ compare it with radioactive, circumstellar interaction and magnetar models. Model\
  \ residuals and light curve polynomial fit residuals are analyzed to estimate the\
  \ undulation timescale and amplitude. We also determine host galaxy properties based\
  \ on imaging and spectroscopy data, including a detection of the [O III]łambda4363,\
  \ auroral line, allowing for a direct metallicity measurement.  Results: We rule\
  \ out the Arnett $^56$Ni decay model for SN 2020qlb's light curve due to unphysical\
  \ parameter results. Our most favored power source is the magnetic dipole spin-down\
  \ energy deposition of a magnetar. Two to three near peak oscillations, intriguingly\
  \ similar to those of SN 2015bn, were found in the magnetar model residuals with\
  \ a timescale of 32 ± 6 days and an amplitude of 6% of peak luminosity.\
  \ We rule out centrally located undulation sources due to timescale considerations;\
  \ and we favor the result of ejecta interactions with circumstellar material (CSM)\
  \ density fluctuations as the source of the undulations."
