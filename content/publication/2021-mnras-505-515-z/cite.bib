 abstract = {We present Cyclic-Permutation Invariant Neural Networks, a novel class
of neural networks (NNs) designed to be invariant to phase
shifts of period-folded periodic sequences by means of 'symmetry
padding'. In the context of periodic variable star light curves,
initial phases are exogenous to the physical origin of the
variability and should thus be immaterial to the downstream
inference application. Although previous work utilizing NNs
commonly operated on period-folded light curves, no approach to
date has taken advantage of such a symmetry. Across three
different data sets of variable star light curves, we show that
two implementations of Cyclic-Permutation Invariant Networks-
iTCN and iResNet-consistently outperform state-of-the-art non-
invariant baselines and reduce overall error rates by between 4
to 22 per cent. Over a 10-class OGLE-III sample, the
iTCN/iResNet achieves an average per-class accuracy of 93.4 per
cent/93.3 per cent, compared to recurrent NN/random forest
accuracies of 70.5 per cent/89.5 per cent in a recent study
using the same data. Finding improvement on a non-astronomy
benchmark, we suggest that the methodology introduced here
should also be applicable to a wide range of science domains
where periodic data abounds.},
