 abstract = {We report the discovery of 87 new T dwarfs uncovered with the Wide-field
Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE) and 3 brown dwarfs with
extremely red near-infrared colors that exhibit characteristics
of both L and T dwarfs. Two of the new T dwarfs are likely
binaries with L7 \ensuremathÂ± 1 primaries and mid-type T
secondaries. In addition, our follow-up program has confirmed 10
previously identified T dwarfs and 4 photometrically selected L
and T dwarf candidates in the literature. This sample, along
with the previous WISE discoveries, triples the number of known
brown dwarfs with spectral types later than T5. Using the WISE
All-Sky Source Catalog we present updated color-color and color-
type diagrams for all the WISE-discovered T and Y dwarfs. Near-
infrared spectra of the new discoveries are presented along with
spectral classifications. To accommodate later T dwarfs we have
modified the integrated flux method of determining spectral
indices to instead use the median flux. Furthermore, a newly
defined J-narrow index differentiates the early-type Y dwarfs
from late-type T dwarfs based on the J-band continuum slope. The
K/J indices for this expanded sample show that 32% of late-type
T dwarfs have suppressed K-band flux and are blue relative to
the spectral standards, while only 11% are redder than the
standards. Comparison of the Y/J and K/J index to models
suggests diverse atmospheric conditions and supports the
possible re-emergence of clouds after the L/T transition. We
also discuss peculiar brown dwarfs and candidates that were
found not to be substellar, including two young stellar objects
and two active galactic nuclei. The substantial increase in the
number of known late-type T dwarfs provides a population that
will be used to test models of cold atmospheres and star
formation. The coolest WISE-discovered brown dwarfs are the
closest of their type and will remain the only sample of their
kind for many years to come.},
