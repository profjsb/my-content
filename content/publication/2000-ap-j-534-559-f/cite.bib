 abstract = {We present multifrequency radio observations from the afterglow of GRB
980519 beginning 7.2 hr after the gamma-ray burst and ending 63
days later. The fast decline in the optical and X-ray light
curves for this burst has been interpreted either as afterglow
emission originating from a collimated outflow-a jet-or the
result of a blast wave propagating into a medium whose density
is shaped by the wind of an evolved massive star. These two
models predict divergent behavior for the radio afterglow, and
therefore radio observations are capable, in principle, of
discriminating between the two. We show that a wind model
describes the subsequent evolution of the radio afterglow rather
well. However, we see strong modulation of the light curve,
which we interpret as diffractive scintillation. These
variations prevent us from decisively rejecting the jet model.},
