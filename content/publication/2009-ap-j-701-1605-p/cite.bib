 abstract = {We present results from an imaging and spectroscopic study of four
strong Mg II absorbers of W(2796) gsim 1 ̊A revealed by the
afterglow of GRB 060418 at z $_GRB$ = 1.491. These absorbers,
at z = 0.603, 0.656, 1.107, and z $_GRB$, exhibit large ion
abundances that suggest neutral gas columns characteristic of
damped Ly\ensuremathα systems. The imaging data include
optical images obtained using Low-Resolution Imaging
Spectrometer (LRIS) on the Keck I telescope and using Advanced
Camera for Surveys on board Hubble Space Telescope, and near-
infrared H-band images obtained using Persson's Auxiliary
Nasmyth Infrared Camera on the Magellan Baade Telescope and
K'-band images obtained using NIRC2 with laser guide star
adaptive optics on the Keck II telescope. These images reveal
six distinct objects at \ensuremathΔ
\ensuremathþeta lsim 3farcs5 of the afterglow's position,
two of which exhibit well-resolved mature disk morphology, one
shows red colors, and three are blue compact sources. Follow-up
spectroscopic observations using LRIS confirm that one of the
disk galaxies coincides with the Mg II absorber at z = 0.656.
The observed broadband spectral energy distributions of the
second disk galaxy and the red source indicate that they are
associated with the absorbers at z = 0.603 and z = 1.107,
respectively. These results show that strong Mg II absorbers
identified in gamma-ray burst (GRB) afterglow spectra are
associated with typical galaxies of luminosity
\ensuremath≈0.1 - 1 L $_*$ at impact parameter of
\ensuremath\o̊ lsim 10 h $^-1$ kpc. The close angular
separation would preclude easy detections toward a bright
quasar. Finally, we associate the remaining three blue compact
sources with the GRB host galaxy, noting that they are likely
star-forming knots located at projected distances of
\ensuremath\r̊ = 2 - 12 h $^-1$ kpc from the afterglow.
At the afterglow's position, we derive a 2\ensuremathσ
upper limit to the underlying star-formation rate intensity of
0.0074 M $_sun$ yr$^-1$ kpc$^-2$. <P />Based in part on
observations made with the NASA/ESA Hubble Space Telescope,
