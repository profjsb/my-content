 abstract = {The optical counterpart of the \ensuremathγ-ray burst GRB
970228 appears to be a transient point source embedded in a
region of extended nebulosity, the latter having been
tentatively identified as a high-redshift galaxy. This would
seem to favour models that place \ensuremathγ-ray
bursts at cosmological distances, although a range of mechanisms
for producing the bursts is still allowed. A crucial piece of
information for distinguishing between such models is how the
brightness of the optical counterpart evolves with time. Here
the authors re-evaluate the existing photometry of the optical
counterpart of GRB 970228 to construct an optical light curve
for the transient event. They find that between 21 hours and six
days after the burst, the R-band brightness decreased by a
factor of \ensuremath≡40, with any subsequent decrease
in brightness occurring at a much slower rate. As the point
source faded, it also became redder. The initial behaviour of
the source appears to be consistent with the ``fireball'' model,
but the subsequent decrease in the rate of fading may prove
harder to explain.},
