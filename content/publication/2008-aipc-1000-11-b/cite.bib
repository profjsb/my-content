 abstract = {From Galactic binary sources, to extragalactic magnetized neutron stars,
to long-duration GRBs without associated supernovae, the types
of sources we now believe capable of producing bursts of gamma-
rays continues to grow apace. With this emergent diversity comes
the recognition that the traditional and newly formulated high-
energy observables used for identifying sub-classes does not
provide an adequate one-to-one mapping to progenitors. The
popular classification of some &gt;100 sec duration GRBs as
``short bursts'' is not only an unpalatable retronym and
syntactically oxymoronic but highlights the difficultly of using
what was once a purely phenomenological classification to encode
our understanding of the physics that gives rise to the events.
Here we propose a physically based classification scheme
designed to coexist with the phenomenological system already in
place and argue for its utility and necessity. <P />},
