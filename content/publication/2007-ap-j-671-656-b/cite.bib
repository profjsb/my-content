 abstract = {We calculate durations and spectral parameters for 218 Swift bursts
detected by the BAT instrument between and including gamma-ray
bursts (GRBs) 041220 and 070509, including 77 events with
measured redshifts. Incorporating prior knowledge into the
spectral fits, we are able to measure the characteristic
\ensuremathνF$_\ensuremathν$ spectral peak energy
E$_pk,obs$ and the isotropic equivalent energy E$_iso$
(1-10$^4$ keV) for all events. This complete and rather
extensive catalog, analyzed with a unified methodology, allows
us to address the persistence and origin of high-energy
correlations suggested in pre-Swift observations. We find that
the E$_pk,obs$-E$_iso$ correlation is present in the Swift
sample; however, the best-fit power-law relation is inconsistent
with the best-fit pre-Swift relation at &gt;5
\ensuremathσ significance. It has a factor
&gt;åisebox-0.5ex~2 larger intrinsic scatter,
after accounting for large errors on E$_pk,obs$. A large
fraction of the Swift events are hard and subluminous relative
to (and inconsistent with) the pre-Swift relation, in agreement
with indications from BATSE GRBs without redshift. Moreover, we
determine an experimental threshold for the BAT detector and
show how the E$_pk,obs$-E$_iso$ correlation arises
artificially due to partial correlation with the threshold. We
show that pre-Swift correlations found by Amati et al., Yonetoku
et al., and Firmani et al., and independently by others are
likely unrelated to the physical properties of GRBs and are
likely useless for tests of cosmology. Also, an explanation for
these correlations in terms of a detector threshold provides a
natural and quantitative explanation for why short-duration GRBs
and events at low redshift tend to be outliers to the
correlations.},
