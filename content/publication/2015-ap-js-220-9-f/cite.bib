 abstract = {CfAIR2 is a large, homogeneously reduced set of near-infrared (NIR)
light curves (LCs) for Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) obtained with
the 1.3 m Peters Automated InfraRed Imaging TELescope. This data
set includes 4637 measurements of 94 SNe Ia and 4 additional SNe
Iax observed from 2005 to 2011 at the Fred Lawrence Whipple
Observatory on Mount Hopkins, Arizona. CfAIR2 includes
\\JHK\\$_s$ photometric measurements for 88 normal and 6
spectroscopically peculiar SN Ia in the nearby universe, with a
median redshift of z ̃ 0.021 for the normal SN Ia. CfAIR2 data
span the range from -13 days to +127 days from B-band maximum.
More than half of the LCs begin before the time of maximum, and
the coverage typically contains ̃13-18 epochs of observation,
depending on the filter. We present extensive tests that verify
the fidelity of the CfAIR2 data pipeline, including comparison
to the excellent data of the Carnegie Supernova Project. CfAIR2
contributes to a firm local anchor for SN cosmology studies in
the NIR. Because SN Ia are more nearly standard candles in the
NIR and are less vulnerable to the vexing problems of extinction
by dust, CfAIR2 will help the SN cosmology community develop
more precise and accurate extragalactic distance probes to
improve our knowledge of cosmological parameters, including dark
energy and its potential time variation.},
