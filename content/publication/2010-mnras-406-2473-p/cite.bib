 abstract = {We present observations and analysis of the broad-band afterglow of
Swift GRB 071025. Using optical and infrared (RIYJHK)
photometry, we derive a photometric redshift of 4.4 &lt; z
&lt; 5.2; at this redshift our simultaneous multicolour
observations begin at ̃30 s after the gamma-ray burst trigger in
the host frame, during the initial rising phase of the
afterglow. We associate the light-curve peak at ̃580 s in the
observer frame with the formation of the forward shock, giving
an estimate of the initial Lorentz factor
\ensuremathΓ$_0$̃ 200. The red spectral energy
distribution (even in regions not affected by the Lyman
\ensuremathα break) provides secure evidence of a large
dust column. However, the inferred extinction curve shows a
prominent flat component between 2000 and 3000 ̊A in the
rest frame, inconsistent with any locally observed template but
well fitted by models of dust formed by supernovae. Time-
dependent fits to the extinction profile reveal no evidence of
dust destruction and limit the decrease in the extinction column
to \ensuremathΔA$_3000$ &lt; 0.54 mag after t= 50 s
in the rest frame. Together with studies of high-z quasars, our
observations suggest a transition in dust properties in the
early Universe, possibly associated with a transition between
supernova-dominated and asymptotic giant branch-dominated modes
of dust production.},
