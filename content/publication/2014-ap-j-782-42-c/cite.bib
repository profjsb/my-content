 abstract = {We present the discovery, classification, and extensive panchromatic
(from radio to X-ray) follow-up observations of PTF11qcj, a
supernova (SN) discovered by the Palomar Transient Factory
(PTF). Our observations with the Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array
show that this event is radio-loud: PTF11qcj reached a radio
peak luminosity comparable to that of the famous gamma-ray-
burst-associated SN 1998bw (L $_5 GHz$ \ensuremath≈
10$^29$ erg s$^-1$ Hz$^-1$). PTF11qcj is also detected
in X-rays with the Chandra Observatory, and in the infrared band
with Spitzer. Our multi-wavelength analysis probes the SN
interaction with circumstellar material. The radio observations
suggest a progenitor mass-loss rate of
åisebox-0.5ex~10$^-4$ M $_☉$ yr$^-1$
× (v$_w$ /1000 km s$^-1$), and a velocity of
\ensuremath≈0.3-0.5 c for the fastest moving ejecta
(at \ensuremath≈10 days after explosion). However,
these estimates are derived assuming the simplest model of SN
ejecta interacting with a smooth circumstellar wind, and do not
account for possible inhomogeneities in the medium and
asphericity of the explosion. The radio data show deviations
from such a simple model, as well as a late-time re-brightening.
The X-ray flux from PTF11qcj is compatible with the high-
frequency extrapolation of the radio synchrotron emission
(within the large uncertainties). A light echo from pre-existing
dust is in agreement with our infrared data. Our pre-explosion
data from the PTF suggest that a precursor eruption of absolute
magnitude M$_r$ \ensuremath≈ -13 mag may have
occurred \ensuremath≈2.5 yr prior to the SN explosion.
Overall, PTF11qcj fits the expectations from the explosion of a
Wolf-Rayet star. Precursor eruptions may be a feature
characterizing the final pre-explosion evolution of such stars.},
