 abstract = {Despite the great promise of machine-learning algorithms to classify and
predict astrophysical parameters for the vast numbers of
astrophysical sources and transients observed in large-scale
surveys, the peculiarities of the training data often manifest
as strongly biased predictions on the data of interest.
Typically, training sets are derived from historical surveys of
brighter, more nearby objects than those from more extensive,
deeper surveys (testing data). This sample selection bias can
cause catastrophic errors in predictions on the testing data
because (1) standard assumptions for machine-learned model
selection procedures break down and (2) dense regions of testing
space might be completely devoid of training data. We explore
possible remedies to sample selection bias, including importance
weighting, co-training, and active learning (AL). We argue that
AL—where the data whose inclusion in the training
set would most improve predictions on the testing set are
queried for manual follow-up—is an effective
approach and is appropriate for many astronomical applications.
For a variable star classification problem on a well-studied set
of stars from Hipparcos and Optical Gravitational Lensing
Experiment, AL is the optimal method in terms of error rate on
the testing data, beating the off-the-shelf classifier by 3.4%
and the other proposed methods by at least 3.0%. To aid with
manual labeling of variable stars, we developed a Web interface
which allows for easy light curve visualization and querying of
external databases. Finally, we apply AL to classify variable
stars in the All Sky Automated Survey, finding dramatic
improvement in our agreement with the ASAS Catalog of Variable
Stars, from 65.5% to 79.5%, and a significant increase in the
classifier's average confidence for the testing set, from 14.6%
to 42.9%, after a few AL iterations.},
