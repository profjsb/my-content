 abstract = {Soft \ensuremathγ-ray repeaters (SGRs) are transient sources of
high-energy photons, whose brief emissions are thought to arise
from young and highly magnetized neutron stars. The exact cause
of these outbursts, and the nature of the energy-loss mechanism
that powers them, remain unknown. Here we report the discovery
of a fading radio source within the X-ray error box of
SGR1900+14. We argue that the radio source is a short-lived
cloud of ionized gas, powered by relativistic particles ejected
at the time of the intense burst of high-energy photons in late
August 1998 (this period of activity also included an extremely
energetic burst of \ensuremathγ-rays on 27 August). As
the radio photons are not beamed, our observations allow us to
constrain the energy released in the form of particles ejected
during the burst. Moreover, the astrometrical precision of radio
observations enable us to determine the exact position of the
source to very high accuracy.},
