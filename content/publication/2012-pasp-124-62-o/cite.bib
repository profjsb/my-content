 abstract = {The Palomar Transient Factory (PTF) provides multiple epoch imaging for
a large fraction of the celestial sphere. Here, we describe the
photometric calibration of the PTF data products that allows the
PTF magnitudes to be related to other magnitude systems. The
calibration process utilizes Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) r ̃
16 mag point-source objects as photometric standards. During
photometric conditions, this allows us to solve for the
extinction coefficients and color terms and to estimate the
camera illumination correction. This also enables the
calibration of fields that are outside the SDSS footprint. We
test the precision and repeatability of the PTF photometric
calibration. Given that PTF is observing in a single filter each
night, we define a PTF calibrated magnitude system for the R
band and g band. We show that, in this system,
\ensuremath≈59% (47%) of the photometrically
calibrated PTF R-band (g-band) data achieve a photometric
precision of 0.02-0.04 mag and have color terms and extinction
coefficients that are close to their average values. Given the
objects\textquoteright color, the PTF magnitude system can be
converted to other systems. Moreover, a night-by-night
comparison of the calibrated magnitudes of individual stars
observed on multiple nights shows that they are consistent to a
level of \ensuremath≈0.02 mag. Most of the data that
were taken under nonphotometric conditions can be calibrated
relative to other epochs of the same sky footprint obtained
during photometric conditions. We provide a concise guide
describing how to use the PTF photometric-calibration data
products, as well as the transformations between the PTF
magnitude system and the SDSS and Johnson-Cousins systems.},
