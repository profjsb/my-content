 abstract = {We present high angular resolution observations with the Keck
Interferometer, high-dispersion spectroscopic observations with
Keck/NIRSPEC, and near-IR photometric observations from PAIRITEL
of a sample of 11 solar-type T Tauri stars in nine systems. We
use these observations to probe the circumstellar material
within 1 AU of these young stars, measuring the circumstellar-
to-stellar flux ratios and angular size scales of the 2.2
\ensuremathÎ¼m emission. Our sample spans a range of
stellar luminosities and mass accretion rates, allowing
investigation of potential correlations between inner disk
properties and stellar or accretion properties. We suggest that
the mechanism by which the dusty inner disk is truncated may
depend on the accretion rate of the source; in objects with low
accretion rates, the stellar magnetospheres may truncate the
disks, while sublimation may truncate dusty disks around sources
with higher accretion rates. We have also included in our sample
objects that are known to be highly variable (based on previous
photometric and spectroscopic observations), and for several
sources, we obtained multiple epochs of spectroscopic and
interferometric data, supplemented by near-IR photometric
monitoring, to search for inner disk variability. While time-
variable veilings and accretion rates are observed in some
sources, no strong evidence for inner disk pulsation is found.},
