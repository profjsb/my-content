 abstract = {Variable x-ray and \ensuremathγ-ray emission is characteristic
of the most extreme physical processes in the universe. We
present multiwavelength observations of a unique
\ensuremathγ-ray-selected transient detected by the
Swift satellite, accompanied by bright emission across the
electromagnetic spectrum, and whose properties are unlike any
previously observed source. We pinpoint the event to the center
of a small, star-forming galaxy at redshift z = 0.3534. Its
high-energy emission has lasted much longer than any
\ensuremathγ-ray burst, whereas its peak luminosity was
̃100 times higher than bright active galactic nuclei. The
association of the outburst with the center of its host galaxy
suggests that this phenomenon has its origin in a rare mechanism
involving the massive black hole in the nucleus of that galaxy.},
