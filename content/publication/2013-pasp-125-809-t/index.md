abstract: "In our effort to complete the census of low-mass stars and brown dwarfs in the immediate solar neighborhood, we present spectra, photometry, proper motions, and distance estimates for 42 low- mass star and brown dwarf candidates discovered by the Wide- field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE). We also present additional follow-up information on 12 candidates selected using WISE data but previously published elsewhere. The new discoveries include 15 M dwarfs, 17 L dwarfs, five T dwarfs, and five objects of other types. Among these discoveries is a newly identified “unusually red L dwarf” (WISE J223527.07 + 451140.9), four peculiar L dwarfs whose spectra are most readily explained as unresolved L + T binary systems, and a T9 dwarf (WISE J124309.61 + 844547.8). We also show that the recently discovered red L dwarf WISEP J004701.06 + 680352.1 may be a low-gravity object and hence young and potentially low-mass (&lt; 25 M$_Jup$)."
