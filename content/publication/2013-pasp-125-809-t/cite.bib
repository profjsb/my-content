 abstract = {In our effort to complete the census of low-mass stars and brown dwarfs
in the immediate solar neighborhood, we present spectra,
photometry, proper motions, and distance estimates for 42 low-
mass star and brown dwarf candidates discovered by the Wide-
field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE). We also present
additional follow-up information on 12 candidates selected using
WISE data but previously published elsewhere. The new
discoveries include 15 M dwarfs, 17 L dwarfs, five T dwarfs, and
five objects of other types. Among these discoveries is a newly
identified “unusually red L
dwarf” (WISE J223527.07 + 451140.9), four
peculiar L dwarfs whose spectra are most readily explained as
unresolved L + T binary systems, and a T9 dwarf (WISE J124309.61
+ 844547.8). We also show that the recently discovered red L
dwarf WISEP J004701.06 + 680352.1 may be a low-gravity object
and hence young and potentially low-mass (&lt; 25 M$_Jup$).},
