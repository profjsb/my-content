 abstract = {We present five new outbursting AM CVn systems and one candidate
discovered as part of an ongoing search for such systems using
the Palomar Transient Factory (PTF). This is the first large-
area, systematic search for AM CVn systems using only large-
amplitude photometric variability to select candidates. Three of
the confirmed systems and the candidate system were discovered
as part of the PTF transient search. Two systems were found as
part of a search for outbursts through the PTF photometric data
base. We discuss the observed characteristics of each of these
systems, including the orbital periods of two systems. We also
consider the position of these systems, selected in a colour-
independent survey, in colour-colour space and compare to
systems selected solely by their colours. We find that the
colours of our newly discovered systems do not differ
significantly from those of previously known systems, but
significant errors preclude a definitive answer.},
