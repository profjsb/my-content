 abstract = {The first two months of the third Advanced LIGO and Virgo observing run
(2019 April-May) showed that distant gravitational-wave (GW)
events can now be readily detected. Three candidate mergers
containing neutron stars (NS) were reported in a span of 15
days, all likely located more than 100 Mpc away. However,
distant events such as the three new NS mergers are likely to be
coarsely localized, which highlights the importance of
facilities and scheduling systems that enable deep observations
over hundreds to thousands of square degrees to detect the
electromagnetic counterparts. On 2019 May 10 02:59:39.292 UT the
GW candidate S190510g was discovered and initially classified as
a binary neutron star (BNS) merger with 98% probability. The GW
event was localized within an area of 3462 deg$^2$, later
refined to 1166 deg$^2$ (90%) at a distance of 227
\ensuremath± 92 Mpc. We triggered Target-of-Opportunity
observations with the Dark Energy Camera (DECam), a wide-field
optical imager mounted at the prime focus of the 4 m Blanco
Telescope at Cerro Tololo Inter-American Observatory in Chile.
This Letter describes our DECam observations and our real-time
analysis results, focusing in particular on the design and
implementation of the observing strategy. Within 24 hr of the
merger time, we observed 65% of the total enclosed probability
of the final skymap with an observing efficiency of 94%. We
identified and publicly announced 13 candidate counterparts.
S190510g was reclassified 1.7 days after the merger, after our
observations were completed, with a “BNS
merger” probability reduced from 98% to 42%
in favor of a “terrestrial classification.},
