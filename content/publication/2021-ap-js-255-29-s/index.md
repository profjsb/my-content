abstract: Several thousand core-collapse supernovae (CCSNe) of different flavors have
  been discovered so far. However, identifying their progenitors has remained an outstanding
  open question in astrophysics. Studies of SN host galaxies have proven to be powerful
  in providing constraints on the progenitor populations. In this paper, we present
  all CCSNe detected between 2009 and 2017 by the Palomar Transient Factory. This
  sample includes 888 SNe of 12 distinct classes out to redshift z ≍ 1. We present
  the photometric properties of their host galaxies from the far- ultraviolet to the
  mid-infrared and model the host-galaxy spectral energy distributions to derive physical
  properties. The galaxy mass function of Type Ic, Ib, IIb, II, and IIn SNe ranges
  from 10$^5$ to 10$^11.5$ M$_ødot$, probing the entire mass range of star-forming
  galaxies down to the least-massive star-forming galaxies known. Moreover, the galaxy
  mass distributions are consistent with models of star- formation-weighted mass functions.
  Regular CCSNe are hence direct tracers of star formation. Small but notable differences
  exist between some of the SN classes. Type Ib/c SNe prefer galaxies with slightly
  higher masses (i.e., higher metallicities) and star formation rates than Type IIb
  and II SNe. These differences are less pronounced than previously thought. H-poor
  superluminous supernovae (SLSNe) and SNe Ic-BL are scarce in galaxies above 10$^10$
  M$_ødot$. Their progenitors require environments with metallicities of
  < 0.4 and < 1 solar, respectively. In addition, the hosts of H-poor SLSNe are dominated
  by a younger stellar population than all other classes of CCSNe. Our findings corroborate
  the notion that low metallicity and young age play an important role in the formation
  of SLSN progenitors.
