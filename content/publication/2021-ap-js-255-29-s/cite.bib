 abstract = {Several thousand core-collapse supernovae (CCSNe) of different flavors
have been discovered so far. However, identifying their
progenitors has remained an outstanding open question in
astrophysics. Studies of SN host galaxies have proven to be
powerful in providing constraints on the progenitor populations.
In this paper, we present all CCSNe detected between 2009 and
2017 by the Palomar Transient Factory. This sample includes 888
SNe of 12 distinct classes out to redshift z ≍ 1. We present the
photometric properties of their host galaxies from the far-
ultraviolet to the mid-infrared and model the host-galaxy
spectral energy distributions to derive physical properties. The
galaxy mass function of Type Ic, Ib, IIb, II, and IIn SNe ranges
from 10$^5$ to 10$^11.5$ M$_\ensuremathødot$,
probing the entire mass range of star-forming galaxies down to
the least-massive star-forming galaxies known. Moreover, the
galaxy mass distributions are consistent with models of star-
formation-weighted mass functions. Regular CCSNe are hence
direct tracers of star formation. Small but notable differences
exist between some of the SN classes. Type Ib/c SNe prefer
galaxies with slightly higher masses (i.e., higher
metallicities) and star formation rates than Type IIb and II
SNe. These differences are less pronounced than previously
thought. H-poor superluminous supernovae (SLSNe) and SNe Ic-BL
are scarce in galaxies above 10$^10$
M$_\ensuremathødot$. Their progenitors require
environments with metallicities of < 0.4 and < 1 solar,
respectively. In addition, the hosts of H-poor SLSNe are
dominated by a younger stellar population than all other classes
of CCSNe. Our findings corroborate the notion that low
metallicity and young age play an important role in the
formation of SLSN progenitors.},
