 abstract = {Of all the well-localized gamma-ray bursts, GRB 000911 has the longest
duration (T$_90$=500 s) and ranks in the top 1% of BATSE
bursts for fluence. Here we report the discovery of the
afterglow of this unique burst. In order to simultaneously fit
our radio and optical observations, we are required to invoke a
model involving a hard electron distribution,
p√•isebox-0.5ex~1.5, and a jet-break time less
than 1.5 days. A spectrum of the host galaxy taken 111 days
after the burst reveals a single emission line, interpreted as
[O II] at a redshift z=1.0585, and a continuum break that we
interpret as the Balmer limit at this redshift. Despite the long
T$_90$, the afterglow of GRB 000911 is not unusual in any
other way when compared to the set of afterglows studied to
date. We conclude that the duration of the GRB plays little part
in determining the physics of the afterglow. Partially based on
observations obtained at the W. M. Keck Observatory, which is
operated by the California Association for Research in
Astronomy, a scientific partnership among the California
Institute of Technology, the University of California, and the
National Aeronautics and Space Administration.},
