 abstract = {We present initial results from a project designed to monitor Ultracool
Dwarfs (UCDs) of late-M to early-L spectral type in the near
infrared (NIR) to evaluate the feasibility of detecting close-
in, planetary companions to small stars. Owing to the small
radii of the UCDs, data obtained with the Peters Automated
Infrared Imaging Telescope (PAIRITEL) should allow us to detect
terrestrial-size transiting planets. A sample of 20 objects was
monitored nightly over a period of four months with a typical
precision of \ensuremath≈1%. To date, more than 106̂
seconds of observations have been collected. We find that UCDs
represent photometrically stable targets suitable for transiting
planet searches in the NIR. We present data from two targets
with representative time coverage and photometric behavior. The
likelihood of detecting an existing close-in planet in the
PAIRITEL data using this observational strategy is simulated. We
demonstrate that with effective integrations of 20 minutes we
achieve 8 mmag rms over a period of 100 days, suggesting
sensitivity to Earth size planets. A campaign to monitor a large
sample of UCDs provides a viable method for detecting
terrestrial planets, super-Earths, and Neptunes potentially
located in the habitable zones of their hosts. <P />},
