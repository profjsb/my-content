 abstract = {Observations show that at least some gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) happen
simultaneously with core-collapse supernovae (SNe), thus linking
by a common thread nature's two grandest explosions. We review
here the growing evidence for and theoretical implications of
this association, and conclude that most long-duration soft-
spectrum GRBs are accompanied by massive stellar explosions
(GRB-SNe). The kinetic energy and luminosity of well-studied
GRB-SNe appear to be greater than those of ordinary SNe, but
evidence exists, even in a limited sample, for considerable
diversity. The existing sample also suggests that most of the
energy in the explosion is contained in nonrelativistic ejecta
(producing the supernova) rather than in the relativistic jets
responsible for making the burst and its afterglow. Neither all
SNe, nor even all SNe of Type Ibc produce GRBs. The degree of
differential rotation in the collapsing iron core of massive
stars when they die may be what makes the difference.},
