 abstract = {We present extensive photometric and spectroscopic observations of PTF1
J071912.13+485834.0, an outbursting AM CVn system discovered by
the Palomar Transient Factory (PTF). AM CVn systems are stellar
binaries with some of the smallest separations known and orbital
periods ranging from 5 to 65 minutes. They are believed to be
composed of a white dwarf accretor and a (semi-)degenerate He-
rich donor and are considered to be the helium equivalents of
cataclysmic variables (CVs). We have spectroscopically and
photometrically identified an orbital period of 26.77
\ensuremath± 0.02 minutes for PTF1 J071912.13+485834.0 and
found a super-outburst recurrence time of greater than 65 days
along with the presence of ``normal''
outbursts—rarely seen in AM CVn systems but well
known in super-outbursting CVs. We present a long-term light
curve over two super-cycles as well as high-cadence photometry
of both outburst and quiescent stages, both of which show clear
variability. We also compare both the outburst and quiescent
spectra of PTF1 J071912.13+485834.0 to other known AM CVn
systems, and use the quiescent phase-resolved spectroscopy to
determine the origin of the photometric variability. Finally, we
draw parallels between the different subclasses of SU UMa-type
CVs and outbursting AM CVn systems. We conclude by predicting
that the PTF may more than double the number of outbursting AM
CVn systems known, which would greatly increase our
understanding of AM CVn systems.},
