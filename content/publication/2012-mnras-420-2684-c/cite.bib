 abstract = {We present the discovery and characterization of PTF10iya, a short-lived
(\ensuremathΔt\ensuremath≈ 10 d, with an
optical decay rate of ̃0.3 mag d$^-1$), luminous (? mag)
transient source found by the Palomar Transient Factory. The
ultraviolet/optical spectral energy distribution is reasonably
well fitted by a blackbody with T\ensuremath≈ (1-2)
× 10$^4$ K and peak bolometric luminosity
L$_BB$\ensuremath≈ (1-5) × 10$^44$
erg s$^-1$ (depending on the details of the extinction
correction). A comparable amount of energy is radiated in the
X-ray band that appears to result from a distinct physical
process. The location of PTF10iya is consistent with the nucleus
of a star-forming galaxy (z= 0.224 05 \ensuremath± 0.000
06) to within 350 mas (99.7 per cent confidence radius), or a
projected distance of less than 1.2 kpc. At first glance, these
properties appear reminiscent of the characteristic 'big blue
bump' seen in the near-ultraviolet spectra of many active
galactic nuclei (AGNs). However, emission-line diagnostics of
the host galaxy, along with a historical light curve extending
back to 2007, show no evidence for AGN-like activity. We
therefore consider whether the tidal disruption of a star by an
otherwise quiescent supermassive black hole may account for our
observations. Though with limited temporal information, PTF10iya
appears broadly consistent with the predictions for the early
'super-Eddington' phase of a solar-type star being disrupted by
a ̃10$^7$ M$_☉$ black hole. Regardless of the precise
physical origin of the accreting material, the large luminosity
and short duration suggest that otherwise quiescent galaxies can
transition extremely rapidly to radiate near the Eddington
limit; many such outbursts may have been missed by previous
surveys lacking sufficient cadence.},
