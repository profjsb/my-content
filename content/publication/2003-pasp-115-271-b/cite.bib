 abstract = {The various possibilities for the progenitors of gamma-ray bursts (GRBs)
manifest in differing observable properties. Through deep
spectroscopic and high-resolution imaging observations of some
GRB hosts, I demonstrate that well-localized long-duration GRBs
are connected with otherwise normal star-forming galaxies at
moderate redshifts of order unity. I test various progenitor
scenarios by examining the offset distribution of GRBs about
their apparent hosts, making extensive use of ground-based
optical data from Keck and Palomar and space-based imaging from
the Hubble Space Telescope. The offset distribution appears to
be inconsistent with the coalescing neutron star binary
hypothesis but statistically consistent with a population of
progenitors that closely traces the ultra-violet light of
galaxies. This is naturally explained by bursts which originate
from the collapse of massive stars. This claim is further
supported by the unambiguous detections of emission ``bumps''
which can be explained as supernovae that occur at approximately
the same time as the associated GRB; if true, GRB 980326 and GRB
011121 provide strong observational evidence connecting
cosmological GRBs to high-redshift supernovae and implicate
massive stars as the progenitors of some long-duration GRBs.
Interestingly, most alternative models of these bumps require
wind-stratified circumburst media; this too, implicates massive
stars. In addition to this work, I also constructed the Jacobs
Camera (JCAM), a dual-beam optical camera for the Palomar
200-inch Telescope designed to follow-up rapid GRB localizations
