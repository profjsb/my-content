 abstract = {Data accumulated over the past year strongly favour the idea that
\ensuremathγ-ray bursts lie at cosmological distances,
although the nature of the power source remains unclear. Here we
report radio observations of the supernova SN1998bw, which
exploded at about the same time, and in about the same
direction, as the \ensuremathγ-ray burst GRB980425. At
its peak, the supernova was unusually luminous at radio
wavelengths. A simple interpretation of the data requires that
the source expanded with an apparent velocity of at least twice
the speed of light, indicating that the supernova was
accompanied by a shock wave moving at relativistic speeds (the
ejects of supernovae are typically characterized by non-
relativistic velocities). The energy of the shock is at least
10$^49$erg, with an inferred ejecta mass of 10$^-5$ solar
masses, and we suggest that the early phase of this shock wave
produced the burst of \ensuremathγ-rays. Although in
general the properties of supernovae are very different from
those of \ensuremathγ-ray bursts, we argue that this
unusual supernova establishes a second class of
\ensuremathγ-ray burst, which is distinctly different
from the cosmological kind.},
