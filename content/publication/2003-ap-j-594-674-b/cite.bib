 abstract = {We present a complete sample of 29 gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) for which it
has been possible to determine temporal breaks (or limits) from
their afterglow light curves. We interpret these breaks within
the framework of the uniform conical jet model, incorporating
realistic estimates of the ambient density and propagating error
estimates on the measured quantities. In agreement with our
previous analysis of a smaller sample, the derived jet opening
angles of those 16 bursts with redshifts result in a narrow
clustering of geometrically corrected gamma-ray energies about
E$_\ensuremathγ$=1.33×10$^51$ ergs;
the burst-to-burst variance about this value is 0.35 dex, a
factor of 2.2. Despite this rather small scatter, we demonstrate
in a series of GRB Hubble diagrams that the current sample
cannot place meaningful constraints upon the fundamental
parameters of the universe. Indeed, for GRBs to ever be useful
in cosmographic measurements, we argue the necessity of two
directions. First, GRB Hubble diagrams should be based upon
fundamental physical quantities such as energy, rather than
empirically derived and physically ill-understood distance
indicators (such as those based upon prompt burst time-profiles
and spectra). Second, a more homogeneous set should be
constructed by culling subclasses from the larger sample. These
subclasses, although now first recognizable by deviant energies,
ultimately must be identifiable by properties other than those
directly related to energy. We identify a new subclass of GRBs
(``f-GRBs'') that appear both underluminous by factors of at
least 10 and exhibit a rapid fading (f$_\ensuremathν$å
isebox-0.5ex~t$^-2$) at early times
(t&lt;\i̊sebox-0.5ex~0.5 day). About 10%-20%
of observed long-duration bursts appear to be f-GRBs.},
