 abstract = {We report simultaneous multicolor near-infrared (NIR) observations of
the supernova associated with X-ray flash 060218 during the
first 16 days after the high-energy event. We find that the
light curve rises and peaks relatively fast compared to other
Type Ic supernovae (SNe Ic), with the characteristic broad NIR
peak seen in all three bands. We find that the rise profile
before the peak is largely independent of NIR wavelength, each
band appearing to transition into a plateau phase around day
10-13. Since the light curve is in the plateau phase when our
observations end at day 16, we can only place limits on the peak
absolute magnitudes, but we estimate that SN 2006aj is one of
the lowest NIR luminosity X-ray flash/gamma-ray burst (XRF/GRB)
associated SNe observed to date. The broad peaks observed in the
JHK$_s$ bands point to a large increase in the NIR
contribution of the total flux output from days 10-16. This
evolution can be seen in the broad color and spectral energy
distribution diagrams constructed using UBVRIJHK$_s$
monochromatic flux measurements for the first 16 days of the
event. Ultimately, a 10 day rise time would make SN 2006aj an
extremely fast rise SN Ic event, faster than SN 1998bw and SN
2003dh, which combined with its underluminous nature indicates a
lower amount of $^56$Ni ejected by the progenitor compared to
other XRF/GRB-SNe. Furthermore, the lack of significant color
change during the rise portion of the burst points to little or
no spectral evolution over the first 10 days of activity in the
NIR.},
