 abstract = {R. Chornock, W. Li, J. S. Bloom, A. A. Miller, D. A. Perley, J. H.
Shiode, and A. V. Filippenko, University of California,
Berkeley, report that inspection of CCD spectra (range 310-920
nm) obtained with LRIS on the Keck I 10-m telescope on June 7.6
UT reveals that 2008cv (CBET 1394) is a type-Ia supernova a few
weeks after maximum brightness. The presence of an absorption
trough near 420 nm attributed to Ti II indicates that the object
may be subluminous, of the supernova-1991bg variety (Filippenko
et al. 1992, A.J. 104, 1543).},
