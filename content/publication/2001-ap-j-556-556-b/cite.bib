 abstract = {We report on optical, near-infrared, and centimeter radio observations
of GRB 000418 that allow us to follow the evolution of the
afterglow from 2 to 200 days after the \ensuremathγ-ray
burst (GRB). In modeling these broadband data, we find that an
isotropic explosion in a constant-density medium is unable to
simultaneously fit both the radio and optical data. However, a
jetlike outflow into either a constant density or wind-
stratified medium with an opening angle of
10°-20° provides a good description of
the data. The evidence in favor of a jet interpretation is based
on the behavior of the radio light curves, since the expected
jet break is masked at optical wavelengths by the light of the
host galaxy. We also find evidence for extinction, presumably
arising from within the host galaxy, with A$^host$$_V$=0.4
mag, as well as host flux densities of F$_R$=1.1
\ensuremathμJy and F$_K$=1.7 \ensuremathμJy. These
values supersede previous work on this burst as a result of the
availability of a broadband data set allowing a global fitting
approach. A model in which the GRB explodes isotropically into a
wind-stratified circumburst medium cannot be ruled out by these
data. However, in examining a sample of other bursts (e.g., GRB
990510, GRB 000301C), we favor the jet interpretation for GRB
000418.},
