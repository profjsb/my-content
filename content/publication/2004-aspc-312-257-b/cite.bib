 abstract = {Observations of late-time optical bumps have been reported for several
GRBs. The timescale for such bumps, and colors of such when
available, find a natural explanation as due to associated
supernovae. Ground-based and HST observations of the afterglow
and bump of GRB 011121, in particular, place the strongest
constraints yet on the physical nature of the supernova and any
alternative explanations, such as supranovae or dust echoes. I
summarize the search for underlying bumps in other GRBs and make
the case for the supernova hypothesis in light of observed bumps
and bump non-detections (e.g., GRB 010921). <P />},
