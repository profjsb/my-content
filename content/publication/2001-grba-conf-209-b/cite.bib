 abstract = {We summarize the results of a comprehensive survey to measure the
location of 20 cosmological gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) in and
around galaxies. We find that all well-localized GRBs to-date
fall within 1.2 arcsec (10 kpc in projection) from the nearest
detected galaxy. We estimate on statistical grounds that most if
not all of these nearby ``host'' galaxies are indeed physically
associated with the respective GRB and not a spurious
superposition. The observed distribution of GRBs offsets about
their hosts are consistent with a progenitor population that
burst near the sites of massive star formation (eg.
``collapsars'') and inconsistent with the modeled location of
degenerate binary systems (eg. neutron-star-neutron-star and
neutron-star-black-hole mergers) which travel far from their
birthsite. <P />},
