abstract: "We summarize the results of a comprehensive survey to measure the location of 20 cosmological gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) in and around galaxies. We find that all well-localized GRBs to-date fall within 1.2 arcsec (10 kpc in projection) from the nearest detected galaxy. We estimate on statistical grounds that most if not all of these nearby ``host'' galaxies are indeed physically associated with the respective GRB and not a spurious superposition. The observed distribution of GRBs offsets about their hosts are consistent with a progenitor population that burst near the sites of massive star formation (eg. ``collapsars'') and inconsistent with the modeled location of degenerate binary systems (eg. neutron-star-neutron-star and neutron-star-black-hole mergers) which travel far from their birthsite. <P />"
