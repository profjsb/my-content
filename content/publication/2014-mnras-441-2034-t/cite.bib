 abstract = {The spiral host galaxy of the Swift GRB 060505 at z = 0.089 was the site
of a puzzling long duration burst without an accompanying
supernova. Studies of the burst environment by Thöne et al.
suggested that this Gamma-ray Burst (GRB) came from the collapse
of a massive star and that the GRB site was a region with
properties different from the rest of the galaxy. We reobserved
the galaxy in high spatial resolution using the VIMOS integral-
field unit at the VLT with a spaxel size of 0.67 arcsec.
Furthermore, we use long-slit high-resolution data from
HIRES/Keck at two different slit positions covering the GRB
site, the centre of the galaxy and an H II region next to the
GRB region. We compare the properties of different H II regions
in the galaxy with the GRB site and study the global and local
kinematic properties of this galaxy. The resolved data show that
the GRB site has the lowest metallicity in the galaxy with ̃1/3
Z$_☉$, but its specific star formation rate (SSFR) of 7.4
M$_☉$ yr$^-1$/L/L* and age (determined by the
H\ensuremathα EW) are similar to other H II regions in
the host. The galaxy shows a gradient in metallicity and SSFR
from the bulge to the outskirts as it is common for spiral
galaxies. This gives further support to the theory that GRBs
prefer regions of higher star formation and lower metallicity,
which, in S-type galaxies, are more easily found in the spiral
arms than in the centre. Kinematic measurements of the galaxy do
not show evidence for large perturbations but a minor merger in
the past cannot be excluded. This study confirms the collapsar
origin of GRB 060505 but reveals that the properties of the H II
region surrounding the GRB were not unique to that galaxy.
Spatially resolved observations are key to know the implications
and interpretations of unresolved GRB hosts observations at
higher redshifts.},
