 abstract = {On 2019 August 14, the Advanced LIGO and Virgo interferometers detected
the high-significance gravitational wave (GW) signal S190814bv.
The GW data indicated that the event resulted from a neutron
star--black hole (NSBH) merger, or potentially a low-mass binary
black hole merger. Due to the low false alarm rate and the
precise localization (23 deg$^2$ at 90\%),
S190814bv presented the community with the best opportunity yet
to directly observe an optical/near-infrared counterpart to a
NSBH merger. To search for potential counterparts, the GROWTH
collaboration performed real-time image subtraction on 6 nights
of public Dark Energy Camera (DECam) images acquired in the
three weeks following the merger, covering
$&gt;$98\% of the localization probability. Using
a worldwide network of follow-up facilities, we systematically
undertook spectroscopy and imaging of optical counterpart
candidates. Combining these data with a photometric redshift
catalog, we ruled out each candidate as the counterpart to
S190814bv and we placed deep, uniform limits on the optical
emission associated with S190814bv. For the nearest consistent
GW distance, radiative transfer simulations of NSBH mergers
constrain the ejecta mass of S190814bv to be $M_\mathrmej &lt;
0.04$åisebox-0.5ex~$M_ødot$ at polar
viewing angles, or $M_\mathrmej &lt;
0.03$\i̊sebox-0.5ex~$M_ødot$ if the opacity
is $ąppa &lt;
2$\rs̊ebox-0.5ex~cm$^2$g$^-1$. Assuming a
tidal deformability for the neutron star at the high end of the
range compatible with GW170817 results, our limits would
constrain the BH spin component aligned with the orbital
momentum to be $ χ &lt; 0.7$ for mass ratios $Q &lt; 6$, with
weaker constraints for more compact neutron stars. We publicly
release the photometry from this campaign at http://www.astro.ca
