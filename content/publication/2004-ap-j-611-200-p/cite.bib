 abstract = {We present Keck/NIRSPEC near-IR images and Magellan/IMACS optical
spectroscopy of the host galaxy of GRB 031203. The host is an
actively star-forming galaxy at z=0.1055+/-0.0001. This is the
lowest redshift GRB to date, aside from GRB 980425. From the
hydrogen Balmer lines, we infer an extinction of
A$_V$=3.62+/-0.25 or a total reddening E$_T$(B-V)=1.17+/-0.1
toward the sight line to the nebular regions. After correcting
for reddening, we perform an emission-line analysis and derive
an ISM temperature of T=13400+/-2000 K and electron density of
n$_e$=300cm$^-3$. These imply a metallicity
[O/H]=-0.72+/-0.15 dex and a roughly solar abundance pattern for
N, Ne, S, and Ar. Integrating H\ensuremathα, we infer a
dust-corrected star formation rate (SFR) of more than 11
M$_solar$ yr$^-1$. These observations have the following
implications: (1) The galaxy has a low K'-band luminosity
Låisebox-0.5ex~L$^*$$_K$/5, typical of GRB
host galaxies. (2) The low redshift indicates GRB 031203 had an
isotropic-equivalent \ensuremathγ-ray energy release
smaller than all previous confirmed GRB events. The burst
discovery raises the likelihood of identifying many additional
low-z, low-flux events with Swift. (3) The large SFR, low
metallicity, and inferred hard radiation field are suggestive of
massive star formation, supporting the collapsar model. (4)
Several lines of evidence argue against the identification of
GRB 031203 as an X-ray flash event.},
