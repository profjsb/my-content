 abstract = {We present and discuss the results of an extensive observational
campaign devoted to GRB071010A, a long-duration gamma-ray burst
detected by the Swift satellite. This event was followed for
almost a month in the optical/near-infrared (NIR) with various
telescopes starting from about 2min after the high-energy event.
Swift XRT observations started only later at about 0.4d. The
light-curve evolution allows us to single out an initial rising
phase with a maximum at about 7min, possibly the afterglow onset
in the context of the standard fireball model, which is then
followed by a smooth decay interrupted by a sharp rebrightening
at about 0.6d. The rebrightening was visible in both the
optical/NIR and X-rays and can be interpreted as an episode of
discrete energy injection, although various alternatives are
possible. A steepening of the afterglow light curve is recorded
at about 1d. The entire evolution of the optical/NIR afterglow
is consistent with being achromatic. This could be one of the
few identified GRB afterglows with an achromatic break in the
X-ray through the optical/NIR bands. Polarimetry was also
obtained at about 1d, just after the rebrightening and almost
coincident with the steepening. This provided a fairly tight
upper limit of 0.9 per cent for the polarized-flux fraction. <P

Silla and Paranal Observatory under programme IDs 080.D-0229,
080.D-0250 and 080.D-792. <P />E-mail:
