 abstract = {On 2019 August 14, the Advanced LIGO and Virgo interferometers detected
the high-significance gravitational wave (GW) signal S190814bv.
The GW data indicated that the event resulted from a neutron
star─black hole (NSBH) merger, or potentially a low-mass binary
BH merger. Due to the low false-alarm rate and the precise
localization (23 deg$^2$ at 90%), S190814bv presented the
community with the best opportunity yet to directly observe an
optical/near-infrared counterpart to an NSBH merger. To search
for potential counterparts, the GROWTH Collaboration performed
real-time image subtraction on six nights of public Dark Energy
Camera images acquired in the 3 weeks following the merger,
covering &gt;98% of the localization probability. Using a
worldwide network of follow-up facilities, we systematically
undertook spectroscopy and imaging of optical counterpart
candidates. Combining these data with a photometric redshift
catalog, we ruled out each candidate as the counterpart to
S190814bv and placed deep, uniform limits on the optical
emission associated with S190814bv. For the nearest consistent
GW distance, radiative transfer simulations of NSBH mergers
constrain the ejecta mass of S190814bv to be M$_ej$ &lt; 0.04
M$_☉$ at polar viewing angles, or M$_ej$ &lt; 0.03 M$_☉$
if the opacity is \ensuremathąppa &lt; 2
cm$^2$g$^\ensuremath-1$. Assuming a tidal deformability
for the NS at the high end of the range compatible with GW170817
results, our limits would constrain the BH spin component
aligned with the orbital momentum to be \ensuremathχ
&lt; 0.7 for mass ratios Q &lt; 6, with weaker constraints for
more compact NSs.},
