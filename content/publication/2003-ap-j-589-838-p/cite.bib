 abstract = {We present the discovery of GRB 020405 made with the Interplanetary
Network (IPN). With a duration of 60 s, the burst appears to be
a typical long-duration event. We observed the 75 arcmin$^2$
IPN error region with the Mount Stromlo Observatory's 50 inch
robotic telescope and discovered a transient source that
subsequently decayed and was also associated with a variable
radio source. We identify this source as the afterglow of GRB
020405. Subsequent observations by other groups found varying
polarized flux and established a redshift of 0.690 to the host
galaxy. Motivated by the low redshift, we triggered observations
with WFPC2 on board the Hubble Space Telescope (HST). Modeling
the early ground-based data with a jet model, we find a clear
red excess over the decaying optical light curves that is
present between day 10 and day 141 (the last HST epoch). This
bump has the spectral and temporal features expected of an
underlying supernova (SN). In particular, the red color of the
putative SN is similar to that of the SN associated with GRB
011121 at late time. Restricting the sample of GRBs to those
with z&lt;0.7, a total of five bursts, red bumps at late times
are found in GRB 970228, GRB 011121, and GRB 020405. It is
possible that the simplest idea, namely, that all long-duration
\ensuremathÎ³-ray bursts have underlying SNe with a
modest dispersion in their properties (especially peak
luminosity), is sufficient to explain the nondetections.},
