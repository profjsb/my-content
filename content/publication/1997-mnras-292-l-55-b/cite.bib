 abstract = {A recent spectrum of the optical afterglow of GRB 970508 suggests that
gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) are cosmological in origin, and it is of
crucial importance to derive an accurate distance to each burst.
If GRBs occur near their host galaxies (&lt;&lt;40 kpc) then
Lyman limit absorption [N(Hi)&gt;=1.6x101̂7 cm\2̂] should be
observable in roughly half the GRB afterglow spectra. Here we
outline the methodology to obtain a redshift from the GRB
afterglow spectrum using the recently installed Space Telescope
Imaging Spectrograph (STIS) instrument on board the Hubble Space
Telescope. A low-resolution spectrum with the Multi-Anode
Microchannel Array (MAMA) detector gives complete spectral
coverage over the wavelength range 1570-3180 Angstroms (near-
ultraviolet: NUV) and 1150-1740 Angstroms (far-ultraviolet:
FUV). Assuming that a Target of Opportunity observation is
conducted soon (&lt;åisebox-0.5ex~3 weeks)
after a bright burst, a relatively small integration time
(\i̊sebox-0.5ex~3 orbits) would be sufficient
to detect the Lyman limit over a wide redshift range (0.3&lt;\ri̊sebox-0.5ex~z&lt;\rae̊box-0.5ex\textasciit
ilde2.2). Detection (or non-detection) of the Lyman limit, in
concert with ground-based observations of nearby galaxies and
Mgii and Civ absorption lines, should provide meaningful
constraints on the relationship of GRBs to galaxies.},
