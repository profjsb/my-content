 abstract = {The Berkeley Transients Classification Pipeline (TCP) is a parallelized
source identification, classification, and broadcast pipeline
which ingests several real-time data torrents and emits science
events of pre-articulated interest. The TCP's classification
machine-learning algorithms are trained using a comprehensive
science class hierarchy of light-curves which are resampled to
emulate the cadence and quality of incoming observatory data
streams. The referenced classified light-curves are contained
within our growing public data warehouse, DotAstro.org
(http://dotastro.org/). To effectively distinguish a source's
classification from neighboring classes or hierarchical parents,
dozens of real-number metrics (``features'') are derived from
its light-curve, color information, spatial context, and
historical data. Upon science class identification (or
reclassification), a VOEvent XML containing all available
information is broadcast to subscribed telescopes and science
groups for followup. Subsequently acquired data for that source
can then be fed back to DotAstro.org which the TCP will use to
reinforce its internal model of the source's science class. <P
