 abstract = {We present densely sampled BVRI light curves of the optical transient
associated with the gamma-ray burst (GRB) 030329, the result of
a coordinated observing campaign conducted at five
observatories. Augmented with published observations of this
GRB, the compiled optical data set contains 2687 photometric
measurements, obtained between 78 minutes and 79 days after the
burst. This data set allows us to follow the photometric
evolution of the transient with unprecedented detail. We use the
data to constrain the light curve of the underlying supernova
(SN) 2003dh and show that it evolved faster than and was
probably somewhat fainter than the Type Ic SN 1998bw, associated
with GRB 980425. We find that our data can be described by a
broken power-law decay perturbed by a complex variable
component. The early- and late-time decay slopes are determined
to be
\ensuremathα$_1$åisebox-0.5ex~1.1
and
\ensuremathα$_2$\i̊sebox-0.5ex~2.
Assuming this single-break power-law model, we constrain the
break to lie between \rs̊ebox-0.5ex~3 and
\rae̊box-0.5ex~8 days after the burst. This
simple, singly broken power-law model, derived only from the
analysis of our optical observations, may also account for
available multiband data, provided that the break happened
\raib̊ox-0.5ex~8 days after the burst. The more
complex double-jet model of Berger et al. provides a comparable
fit to the optical, X-ray, millimeter, and radio observations of
this event. The unique early coverage available for this event
allows us to trace the color evolution of the afterglow during
the first hours after the burst. We detect a significant change
in optical colors during the first day. Our color analysis is
consistent with a cooling-break frequency sweeping through the
optical band during the first day. The light curves of GRB
030329 reveal a rich array of variations, superposed over the
mean power-law decay. We find that the early variations
(&lt;\raiso̊x-0.5ex~8 days after the burst)
are asymmetric, with a steep rise followed by a relatively
slower (by a factor of about 2) decline. The variations maintain
a similar timescale during the first 4 days and then get
significantly longer. The structure of these variations is
similar to those previously detected in the afterglows of
several GRBs.},
