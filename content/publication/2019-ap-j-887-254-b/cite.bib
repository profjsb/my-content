 abstract = {The early optical emission of gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) gives an
opportunity to understand the central engine and first stages of
these events. About 30% of GRBs present flares whose origin is
still a subject of discussion. We present optical photometry of
GRB 180620A with the COATLI telescope and RATIR instrument.
COATLI started to observe from the end of prompt emission at T +
39.3 s and RATIR from T + 121.4 s. We supplement the optical
data with the X-ray light curve from Swift/XRT. We observe an
optical flare from T + 110 s to T + 550 s, with a temporal index
decay \ensuremathα $_O,decay$ = 1.32
\ensuremath± 0.01, and \ensuremathΔt/t = 1.63,
which we interpret as the signature of a reverse shock
component. After the initial normal decay the light curves show
a long plateau from T + 500 s to T + 7800 s in both X-rays and
the optical before decaying again after an achromatic jet break
at T + 7800 s. Fluctuations are seen during the plateau phase in
the optical. Adding to the complexity of GRB afterglows, the
plateau phase (typically associated with the coasting phase of
the jet) is seen in this object after the
“normal” decay phase
(associated with the deceleration phase of the jet), and the jet
break phase occurs directly after the plateau. We suggest that
this sequence of events can be explained by a rapid deceleration
of the jet with t $_ d $ \ensuremathłesssim 40 s due to
the high density of the environment (\ensuremath≈100
cm$^\ensuremath-3$) followed by reactivation of the
central engine, which causes the flare and powers the plateau
phase.},
