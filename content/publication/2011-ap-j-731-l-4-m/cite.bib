 abstract = {Metallicity is expected to influence not only the lives of massive stars
but also the outcome of their deaths as supernovae (SNe) and
gamma-ray bursts (GRBs). However, there are surprisingly few
direct measurements of the local metallicities of different
flavors of core-collapse SNe (CCSNe). Here, we present the
largest existing set of host-galaxy spectra with H II region
emission lines at the sites of 35 stripped-envelope CCSNe. We
derive local oxygen abundances in a robust manner in order to
constrain the SN Ib/c progenitor population. We obtain spectra
at the SN sites, include SNe from targeted and untargeted
surveys, and perform the abundance determinations using three
different oxygen-abundance calibrations. The sites of SNe Ic
(the demise of the most heavily stripped stars, having lost both
H and He layers) are systematically more metal rich than those
of SNe Ib (arising from stars that retained their He layer) in
all calibrations. A Kolmogorov-Smirnov test yields the very low
probability of 1% that SN Ib and SN Ic environment abundances,
which are different on average by
Ã¥isebox-0.5ex~0.2 dex (in the Pettini &amp;
Pagel scale), are drawn from the same parent population. Broad-
lined SNe Ic (without GRBs) occur at metallicities between those
of SNe Ib and SNe Ic. Lastly, we find that the host-galaxy
central oxygen abundance is not a good indicator of the local SN
metallicity; hence, large-scale SN surveys need to obtain local
abundance measurements in order to quantify the impact of
metallicity on stellar death.},
