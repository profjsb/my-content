 abstract = {We report the discovery of a radio transient VLA 232937.2-235553,
coincident with the proposed X-ray afterglow for the gamma-ray
burst GRB 981226. This gamma-ray burst (GRB) has the highest
ratio of X-ray to gamma-ray fluence of all the GRBs detected by
BeppoSAX so far, and yet no corresponding optical transient was
detected. The radio light curve of VLA 232937.2-235553 is
qualitatively similar to that of several other radio afterglows.
At the subarcsecond position provided by the radio detection,
optical imaging reveals an extended R=24.9 mag object, which we
identify as the host galaxy of GRB 981226. Afterglow models that
invoke a jetlike geometry for the outflow or that require an
ambient medium with a radial density dependence, such as that
produced by a wind from a massive star, are both consistent with
the radio data. Furthermore, we show that the observed
properties of the radio afterglow can explain the absence of an
optical transient without the need for large extinction local to
the GRB.},
