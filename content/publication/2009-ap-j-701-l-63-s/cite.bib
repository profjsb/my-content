 abstract = {GRB 080607 has provided the first observational signatures of molecular
absorption bands toward any galaxy hosting a gamma-ray burst
(GRB). Despite the identification of dozens of features as
belonging to various atomic and molecular (H$_2$ and CO)
carriers, many more absorption features remained unidentified.
Here, we report on a search among these features for absorption
from vibrationally excited H$_2$, a species that was predicted
to be produced by the UV flash of a GRB impinging on a molecular
cloud. Following a detailed comparison between our spectroscopy
and static, as well as dynamic, models of H$_2$* absorption,
we conclude that a column density of
10$^17.5\ensuremathÂ±0.2$ cm$^-2$ of H$_2$* was
produced along the line of sight toward GRB 080607. Depending on
the assumed amount of dust extinction between the molecular
cloud and the GRB, the model distance between the two is found
to be in the range 230-940 pc. Such a range is consistent with a
conservative lower limit of 100 pc estimated from the presence
of Mg I in the same data. These distances show that substantial
molecular material is found within hundreds of pc from GRB
080607, part of the distribution of clouds within the GRB host
galaxy.},
