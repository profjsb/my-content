 abstract = {We report the discovery of a radio counterpart to GRB 990123. In
contrast to previous well-studied radio afterglows that rise to
peak flux on a timescale of a week and then decay over several
weeks to months, the radio emission from this gamma-ray burst
(GRB) was clearly detected 1 day after the burst, after which it
rapidly faded away. The simplest interpretation of this ``radio
flare'' is that it arises from the reverse shock. In the
framework of the afterglow models discussed to date, a forward-
shock origin for the flare is ruled out by our data. However, at
late times, some radio afterglow emission (commensurate with the
observed late-time optical emission and the optical afterglow)
is expected from the forward shock. The relative faintness of
the observed late-time radio emission provides an independent
indication of a jetlike geometry in this GRB. We use the same
radio observations to constrain two key parameters of the
forward shock (the peak flux and peak frequency) to within a
factor of 2. These values are inconsistent with the notion
advocated by several authors that the prompt optical emission
detected by the Robotic Optical Transient Search Experiment
smoothly joins the optical afterglow emission. Finally, in
hindsight, we now recognize another such radio flare, and this
suggests that one out of eight GRBs has a detectable radio
flare. This abundance, coupled with the reverse-shock
interpretation, suggests that the radio flare phenomenon has the
potential to shed new light on the physics of reverse shocks in
GRBs.},
