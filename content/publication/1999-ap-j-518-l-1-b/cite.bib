 abstract = {We present deep images of the field of GRB 990123 obtained in a
broadband UV/visible bandpass with the Hubble Space Telescope
(HST) and deep near-infrared images obtained with the Keck I 10
m telescope. The HST image reveals that the optical transient
(OT) is offset by 0.67'' (5.8 kpc in projection) from an
extended, apparently interacting galaxy. This galaxy, which we
conclude is the host galaxy of GRB 990123, is the most likely
source of the absorption lines of metals at a redshift of z=1.6
seen in the spectrum of the OT. With magnitudes of
Gunn-r=24.5+/-0.2 and K=22.1+/-0.3 mag, this corresponds to an
Låisebox-0.5ex~0.5L$_*$ galaxy, assuming
that it is located at z=1.6. The estimated unobscured star
formation rate is \i̊sebox-0.5ex~4 M$_solar$
yr$^-1$, which is typical for normal galaxies at comparable
redshifts. There is no evidence for strong gravitational lensing
magnification of this burst, and some alternative explanation
for its remarkable energetics (such as beaming) may therefore be
required. The observed offset of the OT from the nominal host
center, the absence of broad absorption lines in the afterglow
spectrum, and the relatively blue continuum of the host do not
support the notion that gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) originate from
active galactic nuclei or massive black holes. Rather, the data
are consistent with models of GRBs that involve the death and/or
merger of massive stars. Indeed, the HST image suggests an
intimate connection between GRB 990123 and a star-forming
region. <P />Partially based on the observations obtained at the
W. M. Keck Observatory which is operated by the California
Association for Research in Astronomy, a scientific partnership
among California Institute of Technology, the University of
California, and the National Aeronautics and Space
Administration.},
