 abstract = {It is widely expected that the coming decade will witness the first
direct detection of gravitational waves (GWs). The ground-based
LIGO and Virgo GW observatories are being upgraded to advanced
sensitivity, and are expected to observe a significant binary
merger rate. The launch of The Laser Interferometer Space
Antenna (LISA) would extend the GW window to low frequencies,
opening new vistas on dynamical processes involving massive (M
&gt;åisebox-0.5ex~ 105̂ M_Sun) black holes.
GW events are likely to be accompanied by electromagnetic (EM)
counterparts and, since information carried electromagnetically
is complementary to that carried gravitationally, a great deal
can be learned about an event and its environment if it becomes
possible to measure both forms of radiation in concert.
Measurements of this kind will mark the dawn of trans-spectral
astrophysics, bridging two distinct spectral bands of
information. The aim of this whitepaper is to articulate future
directions in both theory and observation that are likely to
impact broad astrophysical inquiries of general interest. What
will EM observations reflect on the nature and diversity of GW
sources? Can GW sources be exploited as complementary probes of
cosmology? What cross-facility coordination will expand the
science returns of gravitational and electromagnetic
observations? <P />},
