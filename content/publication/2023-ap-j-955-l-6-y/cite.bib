 abstract = {We conduct a systematic tidal disruption event (TDE) demographics
analysis using the largest sample of optically selected TDEs. A
flux-limited, spectroscopically complete sample of 33 TDEs is
constructed using the Zwicky Transient Facility over 3 yr (from
2018 October to 2021 September). We infer the black hole (BH)
mass (M $_BH$) with host galaxy scaling relations, showing
that the sample M $_BH$ ranges from 10$^5.1$ M
$_\ensuremathødot$ to 10$^8.2$ M
$_\ensuremathødot$. We developed a survey efficiency
corrected maximum volume method to infer the rates. The rest-
frame g-band luminosity function can be well described by a
broken power law of $ϕ (L_g)∝ łeft[łeft(L_g
/L_\mathrmbki̊ght)^0.3+łeft(L_g/L_\mathrmbk
\g̊ht)^2.6\rh̊t]^-1$ , with L $_bk$ = 10$^43.1$ erg
s$^-1$. In the BH mass regime of 10$^5.3$
\ensuremathłesssim (M $_BH$/M $_\ensuremathødot$)
\ensuremathłesssim 10$^7.3$, the TDE mass function
follows $ϕ (M_\mathrmBH)∝
M_\mathrmBH^-0.25$ , which favors a flat local BH mass
function (
$dn_\mathrmBH/d\mathrmlogM_\mathrmBH≈
\mathrmconstant$ ). We confirm the significant rate
suppression at the high-mass end (M $_BH$
\ensuremath\gtrsim 10$^7.5$ M $_\ensuremathødot$),
which is consistent with theoretical predictions considering
direct capture of hydrogen-burning stars by the event horizon.
At a host galaxy mass of M $_gal$
\rae̊box-0.5ex~ 10$^10$ M
$_\ensuremathødot$, the average optical TDE rate is
\ensuremath≈3.2 × 10$^-5$ galaxy$^-1$
yr$^-1$. We constrain the optical TDE rate to be [3.7, 7.4,
and 1.6] × 10$^-5$ galaxy$^-1$ yr$^-1$ in
galaxies with red, green, and blue colors.},
