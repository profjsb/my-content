 abstract = {We are proposing to conduct a multicolor, synoptic infrared (IR) imaging
survey of the Northern sky with a new, dedicated 6.5-meter
telescope at San Pedro Mártir (SPM) Observatory. This
initiative is being developed in partnership with astronomy
institutions in Mexico and the University of California. The
4-year, dedicated survey, planned to begin in 2017, will reach
more than 100 times deeper than 2MASS. The Synoptic All-Sky
Infrared (SASIR) Survey will reveal the missing sample of faint
red dwarf stars in the local solar neighborhood, and the
unprecedented sensitivity over such a wide field will result in
the discovery of thousands of z åisebox-0.5ex~
7 quasars (and reaching to z &gt; 10), allowing detailed study
(in concert with JWST and Giant Segmented Mirror Telescopes) of
the timing and the origin(s) of reionization. As a time-domain
survey, SASIR will reveal the dynamic infrared universe, opening
new phase space for discovery. Synoptic observations of over
106̂ supernovae and variable stars will provide better distance
measures than optical studies alone. SASIR also provides
significant synergy with other major Astro2010 facilities,
improving the overall scientific return of community
investments. Compared to optical-only measurements, IR colors
vastly improve photometric redshifts to z
\i̊sebox-0.5ex~ 4, enhancing dark energy and
dark matter surveys based on weak lensing and baryon
oscillations. The wide field and ToO capabilities will enable a
connection of the gravitational wave and neutrino universe -
with events otherwise poorly localized on the sky - to transient
electromagnetic phenomena. <P />},
