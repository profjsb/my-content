 abstract = {The optical afterglow of gamma-ray burst GRB 020813 was observed for 3
hr with the LRIS spectropolarimeter at the Keck I telescope,
beginning 4.7 hr after the burst was detected by the HETE-2. The
spectrum reveals numerous metal absorption lines that we
identify with two systems at z=1.223 and z=1.255. We also detect
an [O II] \ensuremath≈Çambda3727 emission line at z=1.255,
and we identify this galaxy as the likely host of the GRB. After
a correction for Galactic interstellar polarization, the optical
afterglow has a linear polarization of 1.8%-2.4% during
4.7-7.9 hr after the burst. A measurement of p=0.80%+/-0.16%
on the following night by Covino et al. demonstrates significant
polarization variability over the next 14 hr. The lack of strong
variability in the position angle of linear polarization
indicates that the magnetic field in the jet is likely to be
globally ordered rather than composed of a number of randomly
oriented cells. Within the framework of afterglow models with
collimated flows, the relatively low observed polarization
suggests that the magnetic field components perpendicular and
parallel to the shock front are only different by about 20%.},
