 abstract = {Gamma-ray burst astronomy has undergone a revolution in the last three
years, spurred by the discovery of fading long-wavelength
counterparts. We now know that at least the long-duration GRBs
lie at cosmological distances with estimated electromagnetic
energy release of 10$^51$-10$^53$ erg, making these the
brightest explosions in the Universe. In this article we review
the current observational state, beginning with the statistics
of X-ray, optical, and radio afterglow detections. We then
discuss the insights these observations have given to the
progenitor population, the energetics of the GRB events, and the
physics of the afterglow emission. We focus particular attention
on the evidence linking GRBs to the explosion of massive stars.
Throughout, we identify remaining puzzles and uncertainties, and
emphasize promising observational tools for addressing them. The
imminent launch of HETE-2 and the increasingly sophisticated and
coordinated ground-based and space-based observations have
primed this field for fantastic growth. . <P />},
