 abstract = {Developing a multi-survey time-series classifier presents several
challenges. One problem is overcoming the sample selection bias
which arises when the instruments or observing cadences differ
between the training and testing datasets. In this case, the
probabilistic distributions characterizing the sources in the
training survey dataset differ from the source distributions in
the other survey, resulting in poor results when a classifier is
naively applied. To resolve this, we have developed the ALLStars
active learning framework which allows us to bootstrap a
classifier onto a new survey using a small set of optimally
chosen sources which are then presented to users for manual
classification. Several iterations of this crowd-sourcing
process results in a significantly improved classifier. Using
this procedure, we have built a variable star light-curve
classifier using OGLE, Hipparcos, and ASAS survey data. <P />},
