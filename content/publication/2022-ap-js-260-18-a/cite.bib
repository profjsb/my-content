 abstract = {The discovery of the electromagnetic counterpart to the binary neutron
star (NS) merger GW170817 has opened the era of gravitational-
wave multimessenger astronomy. Rapid identification of the
optical/infrared kilonova enabled a precise localization of the
source, which paved the way to deep multiwavelength follow-up
and its myriad of related science results. Fully exploiting this
new territory of exploration requires the acquisition of
electromagnetic data from samples of NS mergers and other
gravitational-wave sources. After GW170817, the frontier is now
to map the diversity of kilonova properties and provide more
stringent constraints on the Hubble constant, and enable new
tests of fundamental physics. The Vera C. Rubin Observatory's
Legacy Survey of Space and Time can play a key role in this
field in the 2020s, when an improved network of gravitational-
wave detectors is expected to reach a sensitivity that will
enable the discovery of a high rate of merger events involving
NSs (åisebox-0.5ex~tens per year) out to
distances of several hundred megaparsecs. We design
comprehensive target-of-opportunity observing strategies for
follow-up of gravitational-wave triggers that will make the
Rubin Observatory the premier instrument for discovery and early
characterization of NS and other compact-object mergers, and yet
unknown classes of gravitational-wave events.},
