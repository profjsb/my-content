 abstract = {Networks are becoming a key element in most current and all future,
telescope and observatory projects. The ability to easily and
efficiently pass observation data, alert data and
instrumentation requests between distributed systems could
enable science as never before. However, any effective large
scale or meta-network of astronomical resources will require a
common communication format or development resources will have
to be continuously dedicated to creating interpreters. The
necessary elements of any astronomy communication can be easily
identified, efficiently described and rigidly formatted so that
both robotic and human operations can use the same data. In this
paper we will explore the current state of notification, what
notification requirements are essential to create a successful
standard and present a standard now under development by the
International Virtual Observatory Alliance (IVOA), called the
VOEvent. <P />},
