 abstract = {We present results of an extensive observing campaign of the short-
duration, hard spectrum gamma-ray burst (GRB) 070724A, aimed at
detecting the radioactively powered emission that might follow
from a binary merger or collapse involving compact objects. Our
multiband observations span the range in time over which this
so-called Li-Paczy\ŉski mini-supernova (mini-SN) could be
active, beginning within 3 h of the GRB trigger and represent
some of the deepest and most comprehensive searches for such
emission. We find no evidence for such activity and place limits
on the abundances and the lifetimes of the possible radioactive
nuclides that could form in the rapid decompression of nuclear
density matter. Furthermore, our limits are significantly
fainter than the peak magnitude of any previously detected
broad-lined Type Ic SN associated with other GRBs, effectively
ruling out a long GRB-like SN for this event. Given the
unambiguous redshift of the host galaxy (z = 0.456), GRB 070724A
represents one of a small, but growing, number of short-hard
GRBs for which firm physical/rest-frame quantities currently
exist. The host of GRB 070724A is a moderately star-forming
galaxy with an older stellar population component and a
relatively high metallicity of 12 + log(O/H)$_KD02$ = 9.1. We
find no significant evidence for large amounts of extinction
along the line of sight that could mask the presence of an SN
explosion and estimate a small probability for chance alignment
with the putative host. We discuss how our derived constraints
fit into the evolving picture of short-hard GRBs, their
potential progenitors and the host environments in which they
are thought to be produced.},
