 abstract = {The Palomar Transient Factory (PTF) is an optical wide-field variability
survey carried out using a camera with a 7.8 deg$^2$ field of
view mounted on the 48 inch Oschin Schmidt telescope at Palomar
Observatory. One of the key goals of this survey is to conduct
high-cadence monitoring of the sky in order to detect optical
transient sources shortly after they occur. Here, we describe
the real-time capabilities of the PTF and our related rapid
multiwavelength follow-up programs, extending from the radio to
the \ensuremathÎ³-ray bands. We present as a case study
observations of the optical transient PTF10vdl (SN 2010id),
revealed to be a very young core-collapse (Type II-P) supernova
having a remarkably low luminosity. Our results demonstrate that
the PTF now provides for optical transients the real-time
discovery and rapid-response follow-up capabilities previously
reserved only for high-energy transients like gamma-ray bursts.},
