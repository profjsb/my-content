 abstract = {Whether supernovae are a significant source of dust has been a long-
standing debate. The large quantities of dust observed in high-
redshift galaxies raise a fundamental question as to the origin
of dust in the Universe since stars cannot have evolved to the
AGB dust-producing phase in high-redshift galaxies. In contrast,
supernovae occur within several millions of years after the
onset of star formation. This white paper focuses on dust
formation in supernova ejecta with US-Extremely Large Telescope
(ELT) perspective during the era of JWST and LSST. <P />},
