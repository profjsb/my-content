 abstract = {We present optical and near-infrared (NIR) photometry for three gamma-
ray burst supernovae (GRB-SNe): GRB 120729A, GRB 130215A/SN
2013ez, and GRB 130831A/SN 2013fu. For GRB 130215A/SN 2013ez, we
also present optical spectroscopy at t - t$_0$ = 16.1 d, which
covers rest-frame 3000-6250 ̊A. Based on Fe ii
\ensuremathłambda5169 and Si ii \ensuremathłambda6355,
our spectrum indicates an unusually low expansion velocity of
\i̊sebox-0.5ex~4000-6350 km s$^-1$, the
lowest ever measured for a GRB-SN. Additionally, we determined
the brightness and shape of each accompanying SN relative to a
template supernova (SN 1998bw), which were used to estimate the
amount of nickel produced via nucleosynthesis during each
explosion. We find that our derived nickel masses are typical of
other GRB-SNe, and greater than those of SNe Ibc that are not
associated with GRBs. For GRB 130831A/SN 2013fu, we used our
well-sampled R-band light curve (LC) to estimate the amount of
ejecta mass and the kinetic energy of the SN, finding that these
too are similar to other GRB-SNe. For GRB 130215A, we took
advantage of contemporaneous optical/NIR observations to
construct an optical/NIR bolometric LC of the afterglow. We fit
the bolometric LC with the millisecond magnetar model of Zhang
&amp; Mészáros (2001, ApJ, 552, L35), which considers
dipole radiation as a source of energy injection to the forward
shock powering the optical/NIR afterglow. Using this model we
derive an initial spin period of P = 12 ms and a magnetic field
of B = 1.1 × 10$^15$ G, which are commensurate
with those found for proposed magnetar central engines of other
long-duration GRBs. <P />Table 3 is only available at the CDS
