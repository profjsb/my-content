 abstract = {We investigate available constraints on the circumstellar medium (CSM)
around long-duration \ensuremathγ-ray burst (GRB)
progenitors from afterglow spectra. We first establish a
statistical sample of five GRB afterglow spectra that have been
collected and analyzed with no prior knowledge of the line-of-
sight properties. This sample is then adopted for a uniform
search of Wolf-Rayet wind signatures, as represented by C IV
\ensuremathłambda\ensuremathłambda1548, 1550
absorption doublets at \ensuremathΔv=-1000 to -5000 km
s$^-1$ from the GRBs (hereafter C IV$_15$). We report the
detection of a single C IV$_15$ absorber at
\ensuremathΔvåisebox-0.5ex~-1500 km
s$^-1$ from GRB 050730 and none in the rest. Our search yields
an estimate of 20% for the incidence of C IV$_15$ absorbers
with rest-frame absorption equivalent width EW(C IV
1548)&gt;0.2 \Å near GRB host galaxies, consistent with
the incidence of intergalactic C IV$_15$ near classical damped
Ly\ensuremathα absorbers toward quasar sight lines.
Including the two C IV$_15$ absorbers previously known toward
GRB 021004, we further demonstrate that the presence of H$^0$,
C$^+$, and Si$^+$ together with the absence of excited
C$^+$ or Si$^+$ argue against a CSM origin. The null result
is consistent with the expectation that the circumburst medium
is fully ionized by the afterglow radiation field. We examine
possible scenarios for the survival of the C$^3+$ ions,
including a clumpy wind model. We find that a clumpy wind is
unable to effectively shield the ionizing radiation and allow
C$^3+$ to survive at r&lt;10 pc from the afterglow. We
conclude that the lack of CSM-originated C IV$_15$ absorbers
is consistent with Wolf-Rayet winds terminating at &lt;30 pc
from their progenitor stars.},
