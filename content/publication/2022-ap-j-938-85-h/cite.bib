100 required to produce a long-duration gamma-ray burst (LGRB),
but which could still produce optical emission resembling LGRB
afterglows. Here we present the results of a search for on-axis
optical afterglows using the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF).
Our search yielded seven optical transients that resemble on-
axis LGRB afterglows in terms of their red colors (g - r > 0
mag), faint host galaxies (r > 23 mag), rapid fading (dr/dt > 1
mag day$^-1$), and in some cases X-ray and radio emission.
Spectroscopy of the transient emission within a few days of
discovery established cosmological distances (redshift z = 0.876
to 2.9) for six of the seven events, tripling the number of
afterglows with redshift measurements discovered by optical
surveys without a \ensuremathγ-ray trigger. A likely
associated LGRB (GRB 200524A, GRB 210204A, GRB 210212B, and GRB
210610B) was identified for four events (ZTF 20abbiixp/AT
2020kym, ZTF 21aagwbjr/AT 2021buv, ZTF 21aakruew/AT 2021cwd, and
ZTF 21abfmpwn/AT 2021qbd) post facto, while three (ZTF
20aajnksq/AT 2020blt, ZTF 21aaeyldq/AT 2021any, and ZTF
21aayokph/AT 2021lfa) had no detected LGRB counterpart. The
simplest explanation for the three ``orphan'' events is that
they were regular LGRBs missed by high-energy satellites owing
to detector sensitivity and duty cycle, although it is possible
that they were intrinsically subluminous in
\ensuremathγ-rays or viewed slightly off-axis. We rule
out a scenario in which dirty fireballs have a similar energy
per solid angle to LGRBs and are an order of magnitude more
common. In addition, we set the first direct constraint on the
ratio of the opening angles of the material producing
\ensuremathγ-rays and the material producing early
optical afterglow emission, finding that they must be
comparable.},
