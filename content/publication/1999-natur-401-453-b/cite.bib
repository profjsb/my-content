 abstract = {Cosmic \ensuremathγ-ray bursts have now been firmly established
as one of the most powerful phenomena in the Universe, releasing
almost the rest-mass energy of a neutron star within the space
of a few seconds (ref. 1). The two most popular models to
explain \ensuremathγ-ray bursts are the coalescence of
two compact objects such as neutron stars or black holes, or the
catastrophic collapse of a massive star in a very energetic
supernova-like explosion. Here we show that, about three weeks
after the \ensuremathγ-ray burst of 26 March 1998, the
transient optical source associated with the burst brightened to
about 60 times the expected flux, based upon an extrapolation of
the initial light curve. Moreover, the spectrum changed
dramatically, with the colour becoming extremely red. We argue
that the new source is an underlying supernova. If our
hypothesis is true then this provides evidence linking
cosmologically located \ensuremathγ-ray bursts with
deaths of massive stars.},
