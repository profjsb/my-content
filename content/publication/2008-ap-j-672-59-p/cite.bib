 abstract = {We analyze the gas kinematics of damped Ly\ensuremathα systems
(DLAs) hosting high-z gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) and those toward
quasars (QSO-DLAs), focusing on three statistics: (1)
\ensuremathΔv$_90$, the velocity interval
encompassing 90% of the integrated optical depth, and (2)
W$_1526$ and (3) W$_1548$, the rest equivalent widths of the
Si II 1526 and C IV 1548 transitions, respectively. The
\ensuremathΔv$_90$ distributions of the GRB-DLAs and
QSO-DLAs are similar; each has median
\ensuremathΔv$_90$ \ensuremath≈ 80 km
s$^-1$ and a significant tail, extending to several hundred km
s$^-1$. This suggests comparable galaxy masses for the parent
populations of GRB-DLAs and QSO-DLAs, and we infer that the
average dark matter halo mass of GRB galaxies is
lesssim10$^12$ M$_☉$. The unique configuration of GRB-DLA
sight lines and the presence (and absence) of fine-structure
absorption together give special insight into the nature of
high-z protogalactic velocity fields. The data support a
scenario in which the \ensuremathΔv$_90$ statistic
reflects dynamics in the interstellar medium (ISM) and
W$_1526$ traces motions outside the ISM (e.g., halo gas and
galactic-scale winds). The W$_1526$ statistic and gas
metallicity [M/H] are tightly correlated, especially for the
QSO-DLAs: [M/H] = a + blog(W$_1526$/1̊A) with a = -0.92
+/- 0.05 and b = 1.41 +/- 0.10. We argue that the W$_1526$
statistic primarily tracks dynamical motions in the halos of
high-z galaxies and interpret this correlation as a mass-
metallicity relation with very similar slope to the trend
observed in local, low-metallicity galaxies. Finally, the GRB-
DLAs exhibit systematically larger W$_1526$ values (&gt;0.5
\Å) than the QSO-DLAs (langleW$_1528$rangle
\ensuremath≈ 0.5 \r̊), which may suggest that
galactic-scale outflows contribute to the largest observed
velocity fields.},
