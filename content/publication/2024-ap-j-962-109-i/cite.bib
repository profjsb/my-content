 abstract = {We present the discovery and analysis of SN 2022oqm, a Type Ic supernova
(SN) detected <1 day after the explosion. The SN rises to a blue
and short-lived (2 days) initial peak. Early-time spectral
observations of SN 2022oqm show a hot (40,000 K) continuum with
high ionization C and O absorption features at velocities of
4000 km s$^‑1$, while its photospheric radius expands at
20,000 km s$^‑1$, indicating a pre-existing distribution of
expanding C/O material. After \ensuremath∼2.5 days, both
the spectrum and light curves evolve into those of a typical SN
Ic, with line velocities of \ensuremath∼10,000 km
s$^‑1$, in agreement with the evolution of the photospheric
radius. The optical light curves reach a second peak at t
\ensuremath≈ 15 days. By t = 60 days, the spectrum of
SN 2022oqm becomes nearly nebular, displaying strong Ca II and
[Ca II] emission with no detectable [O I], marking this event as
Ca-rich. The early behavior can be explained by 10$^‑3$ M
$_\ensuremathødot$ of optically thin circumstellar
material (CSM) surrounding either (1) a massive compact
progenitor such as a Wolf–Rayet star, (2) a massive
stripped progenitor with an extended envelope, or (3) a binary
system with a white dwarf. We propose that the early-time light
curve is powered by both the interaction of the ejecta with the
optically thin CSM and shock cooling (in the massive star
scenario). The observations can be explained by CSM that is
optically thick to X-ray photons, is optically thick in the
lines as seen in the spectra, and is optically thin to visible-
light continuum photons that come either from downscattered
X-rays or from the shock-heated ejecta. Calculations show that
this scenario is self-consistent.},
