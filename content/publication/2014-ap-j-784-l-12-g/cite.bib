 abstract = {We report on the discovery of SN 2014J in the nearby galaxy M82. Given
its proximity, it offers the best opportunity to date to study a
thermonuclear supernova (SN) over a wide range of the
electromagnetic spectrum. Optical, near-IR, and mid-IR
observations on the rising light curve, orchestrated by the
intermediate Palomar Transient Factory, show that SN 2014J is a
spectroscopically normal Type Ia supernova (SN Ia), albeit
exhibiting high-velocity features in its spectrum and heavily
reddened by dust in the host galaxy. Our earliest detections
start just hours after the fitted time of explosion. We use
high-resolution optical spectroscopy to analyze the dense
intervening material and do not detect any evolution in the
resolved absorption features during the light curve rise.
Similar to other highly reddened SNe Ia, a low value of total-
to-selective extinction, R$_V$
&lt;Ã¥isebox-0.5ex~ 2, provides the best match
to our observations. We also study pre-explosion optical and
near-IR images from Hubble Space Telescope with special emphasis
on the sources nearest to the SN location.},
