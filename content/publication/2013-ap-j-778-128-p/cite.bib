 abstract = {We present observations and analysis of the host galaxies of 23 heavily
dust-obscured gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) observed by the Swift
satellite during the years 2005-2009, representing all GRBs with
an unambiguous host-frame extinction of A$_V$ &gt; 1 mag from
this period. Deep observations with Keck, Gemini, Very Large
Telescope, Hubble Space Telescope, and Spitzer successfully
detect the host galaxies and establish spectroscopic or
photometric redshifts for all 23 events, enabling us to provide
measurements of the intrinsic host star formation rates, stellar
masses, and mean extinctions. Compared to the hosts of
unobscured GRBs at similar redshifts, we find that the hosts of
dust-obscured GRBs are (on average) more massive by about an
order of magnitude and also more rapidly star forming and dust
obscured. While this demonstrates that GRBs populate all types
of star-forming galaxies, including the most massive, luminous
systems at z \ensuremath≈ 2, at redshifts below 1.5
the overall GRB population continues to show a highly
significant aversion to massive galaxies and a preference for
low-mass systems relative to what would be expected given a
purely star-formation-rate-selected galaxy sample. This supports
the notion that the GRB rate is strongly dependent on
metallicity, and may suggest that the most massive galaxies in
the universe underwent a transition in their chemical properties
åisebox-0.5ex~9 Gyr ago. We also conclude
that, based on the absence of unobscured GRBs in massive
galaxies and the absence of obscured GRBs in low-mass galaxies,
the dust distributions of the lowest-mass and the highest-mass
galaxies are relatively homogeneous, while intermediate-mass
galaxies (\i̊sebox-0.5ex~10$^9$ M $_☉$)
have diverse internal properties.},
