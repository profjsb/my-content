 abstract = {In the epoch of precise and accurate cosmology, cross-confirmation using
a variety of cosmographic methods is paramount to circumvent
systematic uncertainties. Owing to progenitor histories and
explosion physics differing from those of Type Ia supernovae
(SNe Ia), Type II-plateau supernovae (SNe II-P) are unlikely to
be affected by evolution in the same way. Based on a new
analysis of 17 SNe II-P, and on an improved methodology, we find
that SNe II-P are good standardizable candles, almost comparable
to SNe Ia. We derive a tight Hubble diagram with a dispersion of
10% in distance, using the simple correlation between
luminosity and photospheric velocity introduced by Hamuy and
Pinto. We show that the descendent method of Nugent et al. can
be further simplified and that the correction for dust
extinction has low statistical impact. We find that our SN
sample favors, on average, a very steep dust law with total to
selective extinction R$_V$ &lt; 2. Such an extinction law has
been recently inferred for many SNe Ia. Our results indicate
that a distance measurement can be obtained with a single
spectrum of a SN II-P during the plateau phase combined with
sparse photometric measurements.},
