 abstract = {Given the paucity of empirical constraints, the nature of the newly
recognized phenomena called X-ray flashes (XRFs) has been an
open question. However, with the recent detections of radio and
X-ray afterglow it is finally possible to study the large- and
small-scale environments of XRFs. We present Chandra, Hubble
Space Telescope (HST), and Keck observations of the fields of
XRFs 011030 and 020427. Astrometric comparisons of the X-ray
transient positions and the HST images reveal the XRFs to be
associated with faint blue galaxies. Photometric evidence of
these putative hosts suggests that these two XRFs originated
from redshifts less than z√•isebox-0.5ex~3.5,
and thus cannot be due to GRBs at very high redshifts. In both
host-burst offsets and host properties, these XRFs could have
been drawn from distributions similar to those measured of
gamma-ray bursts (GRBs). We conclude with a discussion of the
implications of this XRF-GRB host connection for the possible
progenitors of XRFs.},
