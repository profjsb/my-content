 abstract = {DEEPCR is a deep-learning-based cosmic-ray rejection algorithm
previously demonstrated to be superior to state-of-the-art
LACosmic on Hubble Space Telescope (HST) Advanced Camera for
Surveys (ACS)/WFC F606W imaging data. In this research note, we
present a new DEEPCR model for use on all filters of HST
ACS/WFC. We train and test the model with ACS/WFC F435W, F606W,
and F814W images, covering the entire spectral range of the ACS
optical channel. The global model demonstrates near 100%
detection rates of CRs in extragalactic fields and globular
clusters and 91% in resolved galaxy fields. We further confirm
the global applicability of the model by comparing its
performance against single-filter models that were trained
simultaneously and by testing the global model on data from
another filter which was not previously used for training.},
