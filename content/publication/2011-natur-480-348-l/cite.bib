 abstract = {Type Ia supernovae are thought to result from a thermonuclear explosion
of an accreting white dwarf in a binary system, but little is
known of the precise nature of the companion star and the
physical properties of the progenitor system. There are two
classes of models: double-degenerate (involving two white dwarfs
in a close binary system) and single-degenerate models. In the
latter, the primary white dwarf accretes material from a
secondary companion until conditions are such that carbon
ignites, at a mass of 1.38 times the mass of the Sun. The type
Ia supernova SN 2011fe was recently detected in a nearby galaxy.
Here we report an analysis of archival images of the location of
SN 2011fe. The luminosity of the progenitor system (especially
the companion star) is 10-100 times fainter than previous limits
on other type Ia supernova progenitor systems, allowing us to
rule out luminous red giants and almost all helium stars as the
mass-donating companion to the exploding white dwarf.},
