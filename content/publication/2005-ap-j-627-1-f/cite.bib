 abstract = {The use of gamma-ray burst (GRB) energetics for cosmography has long
been advanced as a means to probe out to high redshifts, to the
epoch of deceleration. However, although relatively immune to
systematic biases from dust extinction, the prompt energy
release in GRBs, even when corrected for jetting geometry, is
far from being a standard candle. In this work we explore the
cosmographic potential of a GRB standard candle based on the
newly discovered relation by Ghirlanda and coworkers between the
apparent geometry-corrected energies
(E$_\ensuremathγ$) and the peak in the rest-frame
prompt-burst spectrum (E$_p$). We present an explicit, self-
consistent formalism for correcting GRB energies with a thorough
accounting for observational uncertainties. In contrast to other
work, we demonstrate that the current sample of 19 GRBs is not
yet cosmographically competitive with results from Type Ia
supernovae (SNe Ia), large-scale structure, and the microwave
background. Although the E$_p$-E$_\ensuremathγ$
relation is a highly significant correlation across a range of
cosmologies [0&lt;=\ensuremathØmega$_M$,
\ensuremathØmega$_\ensuremathŁambda$&lt;=2], the
goodness of fit of the data to a power law (E$_p$åisebox-0.
5ex~E$^\ensuremathη$$_\ensuremath\gam
ma$) depends strongly on input assumptions. The most
important of these assumptions concern the unknown density (and
density profile) of the circumburst medium, the efficiency of
converting explosion energy to gamma rays, data selection
choices for individual bursts (some of which were not included
in similar work), and assumptions in the error analysis.
Independent of assumptions, with very few low-z bursts, the
current sample is most sensitive to \ensuremathØmega$_M$
but essentially insensitive to
\ensuremathØmega$_\ensuremathŁambda$ (let alone the
dark energy equation of state w). The relation clearly
represents a significant improvement in the search for an
empirical GRB standard candle but is further hindered by an
unknown physical basis for the relation, the lack of a low-z
training set to calibrate the relation in a cosmology-
independent way, and several major potential systematic
uncertainties and selection effects. Until these concerns are
addressed, a larger sample is acquired, and attempts are made to
marginalize or perform Monte Carlo simulations over the unknown
density distribution (which itself may evolve with redshift), we
urge caution concerning claims of the utility of GRBs for
cosmography and especially attempts to combine the results from
GRBs with those of SNe Ia.},
