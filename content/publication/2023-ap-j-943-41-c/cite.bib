 abstract = {During the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) Phase I operations, 78
hydrogen-poor superluminous supernovae (SLSNe-I) were discovered
in less than 3 yr, constituting the largest sample from a single
survey. This paper (Paper I) presents the data, including the
optical/UV light curves and classification spectra, while Paper
II in this series will focus on the detailed analysis of the
light curves and modeling. Our photometry is primarily taken by
ZTF in the g, r, and i bands, and with additional data from
other ground-based facilities and Swift. The events of our
sample cover a redshift range of z = 0.06 - 0.67, with a median
and 1\ensuremathσ error (16% and 84% percentiles) of
$z_\mathrmmed=0.265_-0.135^+0.143$ . The peak
luminosity covers -22.8 mag \ensuremathłeq M $_ g,peak$
\ensuremathłeq -19.8 mag, with a median value of
$-21.48_-0.61^+1.13$ mag. The light curves evolve slowly
with a mean rest-frame rise time of t $_rise$ = 41.9
\ensuremath± 17.8 days. The luminosity and timescale
distributions suggest that low-luminosity SLSNe-I with a peak
luminosity åisebox-0.5ex~-20 mag or extremely
fast-rising events (<10 days) exist, but are rare. We confirm
previous findings that slowly rising SLSNe-I also tend to fade
slowly. The rest-frame color and temperature evolution show
large scatters, suggesting that the SLSN-I population may have
diverse spectral energy distributions. The peak rest-frame color
shows a moderate correlation with the peak absolute magnitude,
i.e., brighter SLSNe-I tend to have bluer colors. With optical
and UV photometry, we construct the bolometric luminosity and
derive a bolometric correction relation that is generally
applicable for converting g, r-band photometry to the bolometric
luminosity for SLSNe-I.},
