abstract: During the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) Phase I operations, 78 hydrogen-poor
  superluminous supernovae (SLSNe-I) were discovered in less than 3 yr, constituting
  the largest sample from a single survey. This paper (Paper I) presents the data,
  including the optical/UV light curves and classification spectra, while Paper II
  in this series will focus on the detailed analysis of the light curves and modeling.
  Our photometry is primarily taken by ZTF in the g, r, and i bands, and with additional
  data from other ground-based facilities and Swift. The events of our sample cover
  a redshift range of z = 0.06 - 0.67, with a median and 1σ error (16% and
  84% percentiles) of $z_mathrmmed=0.265_-0.135^+0.143$ . The peak luminosity covers
  -22.8 mag łeq M $_ g,peak$ łeq -19.8 mag, with a median value
  of $-21.48_-0.61^+1.13$ mag. The light curves evolve slowly with a mean rest-frame
  rise time of t $_rise$ = 41.9 ± 17.8 days. The luminosity and timescale
  distributions suggest that low-luminosity SLSNe-I with a peak luminosity åisebox-0.5ex -20
  mag or extremely fast-rising events (<10 days) exist, but are rare. We confirm previous
  findings that slowly rising SLSNe-I also tend to fade slowly. The rest-frame color
  and temperature evolution show large scatters, suggesting that the SLSN-I population
  may have diverse spectral energy distributions. The peak rest-frame color shows
  a moderate correlation with the peak absolute magnitude, i.e., brighter SLSNe-I
  tend to have bluer colors. With optical and UV photometry, we construct the bolometric
  luminosity and derive a bolometric correction relation that is generally applicable
  for converting g, r-band photometry to the bolometric luminosity for SLSNe-I.
