abstract: "The energy release in prompt Î³- and X-rays is a fundamental parameter in the study of the explosion mechanism and the central engines of GRBs. Though the apparent standardizability of GRB energetics have lead some to suggest that GRBs might be useful for cosmography, it is unlikely that GRBs can competitive with other high-precision cosmography experiments. Instead, by fixing a cosmology, there is a great deal more to be learned about long duration GRBs themselves. <P />"
