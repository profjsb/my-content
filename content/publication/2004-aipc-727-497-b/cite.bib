 abstract = {The energy release in prompt \ensuremathÎ³- and X-rays is a
fundamental parameter in the study of the explosion mechanism
and the central engines of GRBs. Though the apparent
standardizability of GRB energetics have lead some to suggest
that GRBs might be useful for cosmography, it is unlikely that
GRBs can competitive with other high-precision cosmography
experiments. Instead, by fixing a cosmology, there is a great
deal more to be learned about long duration GRBs themselves. <P
