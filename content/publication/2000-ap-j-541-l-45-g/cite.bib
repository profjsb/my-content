 abstract = {The millimeter wavelength emission from GRB 991208 is the second
brightest ever detected, yielding a unique data set. We present
here well-sampled spectra and light curves over more than two
decades in frequency for a 2 week period. This data set has
allowed us for the first time to trace the evolution of the
characteristic synchrotron self-absorption frequency
\ensuremathν$_a$, peak frequency
\ensuremathν$_m$, and the peak flux density F$_m$; we
obtain \ensuremathν$_a$åisebox-0.5ex~t
$^-0.15+/-0.23$, \ensuremathν$_m$\i̊sebox-0.5ex\tex
tasciitildet$^-1.7+/-0.7$, and
F$_m$\rs̊ebox-0.5ex~t$^-0.47+/-0.20$. From
the radio data we find that models of homogeneous or wind-
generated ambient media with a spherically symmetric outflow can
be ruled out. A model in which the relativistic outflow is
collimated (a jet) can account for the observed evolution of the
synchrotron parameters, the rapid decay at optical wavelengths,
and the observed radio-to-optical spectral flux distributions
that we present here, provided that the jet transition has not
been fully completed in the first 2 weeks after the event. These
observations provide additional evidence that rapidly decaying
optical/X-ray afterglows are due to jets and that such
transitions either develop very slowly or perhaps never reach
the predicted asymptotic decay
