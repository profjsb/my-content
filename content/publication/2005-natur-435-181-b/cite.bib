 abstract = {The explosion that results in a cosmic \ensuremathγ-ray burst
(GRB) is thought to produce emission from two physical
processes: the central engine gives rise to the high-energy
emission of the burst through internal shocking, and the
subsequent interaction of the flow with the external environment
produces long-wavelength afterglows. Although observations of
afterglows continue to refine our understanding of GRB
progenitors and relativistic shocks, \ensuremathγ-ray
observations alone have not yielded a clear picture of the
origin of the prompt emission nor details of the central engine.
Only one concurrent visible-light transient has been found and
it was associated with emission from an external shock. Here we
report the discovery of infrared emission contemporaneous with a
GRB, beginning 7.2 minutes after the onset of GRB 041219a (ref.
8). We acquired 21 images during the active phase of the burst,
yielding early multi-colour observations. Our analysis of the
initial infrared pulse suggests an origin consistent with
internal shocks.},
