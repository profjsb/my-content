 abstract = {The Berkeley Transients Classification Pipeline (TCP) is a source
identification, classification, and broadcast pipeline which
federates data streams from multiple surveys. The TCP identifies
variable science by making probabilistic statements about the
scientific classification of newly discovered sources observed
by the Palomar Transient Factory\textquoterights all sky
survey. The primary purpose of PTF is to consistently map the
available sky with the intent to discover a variety of galactic
and extragalactic transient sources and events. The TCP
identifies and alerts follow-up telescopes such as PAIRITEL
(Bloom et al. 2005) and end users to these newly discovered
transient sources. Here we discuss software used within the TCP
to generate science classifiers when little or no data has been
acquired by the survey of interest. This case proves more
challenging than when generating classifiers for a well
populated survey. We present some of the difficulties
encountered and a parallelized Hadoop/MapReduce based technique
we use to resolve them. <P />},
