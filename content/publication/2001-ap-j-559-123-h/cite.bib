 abstract = {GRB 000926 has one of the best-studied afterglows to date, with multiple
X-ray observations, as well as extensive multifrequency optical
and radio coverage. Broadband afterglow observations, spanning
from X-ray to radio frequencies, provide a probe of the density
structure of the circumburst medium, as well as of the ejecta
energetics, geometry, and physical parameters of the
relativistic blast wave resulting from the explosion. We present
an analysis of Chandra X-Ray Observatory observations of this
event, along with Hubble Space Telescope and radio monitoring
data. We combine these data with ground-based optical and IR
observations and fit the synthesized afterglow light curve using
models where collimated ejecta expand into a surrounding medium.
We find that we can explain the broadband light curve with
reasonable physical parameters if the cooling is dominated by
inverse Compton scattering. For this model, an excess due to
inverse Compton scattering appears above the best-fit
synchrotron spectrum in the X-ray band. No previous bursts have
exhibited this component, and its observation would imply that
the GRB exploded in a moderately dense
(n√•isebox-0.5ex~30 cm$^-3$) medium,
consistent with a diffuse interstellar cloud environment. <P />},
