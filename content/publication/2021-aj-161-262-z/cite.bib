 abstract = {Fast and automated inference of binary-lens, single-source (2L1S)
microlensing events with sampling-based Bayesian algorithms
(e.g., Markov Chain Monte Carlo, MCMC) is challenged on two
fronts: the high computational cost of likelihood evaluations
with microlensing simulation codes, and a pathological parameter
space where the negative-log-likelihood surface can contain a
multitude of local minima that are narrow and deep. Analysis of
2L1S events usually involves grid searches over some parameters
to locate approximate solutions as a prerequisite to posterior
sampling, an expensive process that often requires human-in-the-
loop domain expertise. As the next-generation, space-based
microlensing survey with the Roman Space Telescope is expected
to yield thousands of binary microlensing events, a new fast and
automated method is desirable. Here, we present a likelihood-
free inference approach named amortized neural posterior
estimation, where a neural density estimator (NDE) learns a
surrogate posterior $\hatp(\boldsymbolþeta |
\boldsymbolx)$ as an observation-parameterized conditional
probability distribution, from pre-computed simulations over the
full prior space. Trained on 291,012 simulated Roman-like 2L1S
simulations, the NDE produces accurate and precise posteriors
within seconds for any observation within the prior support
without requiring a domain expert in the loop, thus allowing for
real-time and automated inference. We show that the NDE also
captures expected posterior degeneracies. The NDE posterior
could then be refined into the exact posterior with a downstream
MCMC sampler with minimal burn-in steps.},
