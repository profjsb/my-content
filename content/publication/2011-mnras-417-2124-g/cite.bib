 abstract = {We report the detection of a faint optical flash by the 2-m Faulkes
Telescope North simultaneously with the second of two prompt
\ensuremathγ-ray pulses in INTEGRAL gamma-ray burst
(GRB) 080603A, beginning at t$_rest$= 37 s after the onset of
the GRB. This optical flash appears to be distinct from the
subsequent emerging afterglow emission, for which we present
comprehensive broad-band radio to X-ray light curves to 13 d
post-burst and rigorously test the standard fireball model. The
intrinsic extinction towards GRB 080603A is high (A$_V, z$=
0.8 mag), and the well-sampled X-ray-to-near-infrared spectral
energy distribution is interesting in requiring an LMC2
extinction profile, in contrast to the majority of GRBs.
Comparison of the \ensuremathγ-ray and extinction-
corrected optical flux densities of the flash rules out an
inverse-Compton origin for the prompt
\ensuremathγ-rays; instead, we suggest that the optical
flash could originate from the inhomogeneity of the relativistic
flow. In this scenario, a large velocity irregularity in the
flow produces the prompt \ensuremathγ-rays, followed by
a milder internal shock at a larger radius that would cause the
optical flash. Flat \ensuremathγ-ray spectra, roughly
F\ensuremath∝\ensuremathν$^-0.1$, are observed
in many GRBs. If the flat spectrum extends down to the optical
band in GRB 080603A, the optical flare could be explained as the
low-energy tail of the \ensuremathγ-ray emission. If
this is indeed the case, it provides an important clue to
understanding the nature of the emission process in the prompt
phase of GRBs and highlights the importance of deep (R &gt; 20
mag), rapid follow-up observations capable of detecting faint,
prompt optical emission.},
