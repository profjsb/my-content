 abstract = {E. O. Ofek, D. A. Howell, M. M. Kasliwal, A. Gal-Yam, J. S. Bloom, P.
Nugent, M. Sullivan, R. Quimby, S. B. Cenko, D. Poznanski, and
S. R. Kulkarni, on behalf of the ``Palomar Transient Factory''
collaboration, report their discovery of a young, broad-line
type-Ic supernova (magnitude R = 18.8) on Feb. 23.504 UT. The
new object, designated 2010ah, is located at R.A. =
11h44m02s.99, Decl. = +55o41'27``.6 (equinox 2000.0), which is
about 5''.2 from the galaxy SDSS J114402.98+554122.5 in p.a. 7
deg. Nothing is visible at this position in previous images of
the same field taken on Feb. 19.439 (limiting magnitude R about
20.9). A spectrum obtained by the queue observing team (courtesy
of the Gemini telescope staff) at the Gemini-North telescope on
Mar. 2, reduced and typed by Howell using the superfit spectrum
fitting code, resembles that of SN 1998bw at about three days
prior to maximum light (Galama et al. 1998, Nature 395, 670),
and shows very broad lines. SN 2010ah is at z = 0.0498, based on
the O II, H-alpha, H-beta, and S II emission lines from the host
galaxy. A multi-wavelength follow-up campaign is ongoing.},
