 abstract = {We report the results of a 944 epoch survey for transient sources with
archival data from the Very Large Array spanning 22 years with a
typical epoch separation of 7 days. Observations were obtained
at 5 or 8.4 GHz for a single field of view and achieved a
typical point-source detection threshold at the beam center of
300 \ensuremathμJy per epoch. Ten transient sources were
detected with a significance threshold such that only one false
positive would be expected. Of these transients, eight were
detected in only a single epoch. Two transients were too faint
to be detected in individual epochs but were detected in 2 month
averages. None of the 10 transients was detected in longer term
averages or associated with persistent emission in the deep
image produced from the combination of all epochs. The
cumulative rate for the short-timescale radio transients above
370 \ensuremathμJy at 5 and 8.4 GHz is 0.07 deg$^-2$ yr$
^-1$&lt;åisebox-0.5ex~R&lt;\i̊sebox-0.5e
x~40 deg$^-2$ yr$^-1$, where the uncertainty
is due to the unknown duration of the transients, 20 minutes
&lt; t$_char$ &lt; 7 days. A two-epoch survey for transients
will detect 1.5+/-0.4 transients per square degree above a flux
density of 370 \ensuremathμJy. Two transients are
associated with galaxies at z=0.040 and z=0.249. These may be
similar to the peculiar Type Ib/c radio supernova SN 1998bw
associated with GRB 980428. We detect no counterparts for six
transients in deep optical and infrared imaging. The hosts and
progenitors of these transients are unknown.},
