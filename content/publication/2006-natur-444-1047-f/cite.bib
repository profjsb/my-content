 abstract = {It is now accepted that long-duration \ensuremathγ-ray bursts
(GRBs) are produced during the collapse of a massive
star$^1,2$. The standard `collapsar' model$^3$ predicts that
a broad-lined and luminous type Ic core-collapse supernova
accompanies every long-duration GRB$^4$. This association has
been confirmed in observations of several nearby GRBs$^5-9$.
Here we report that GRB060505 (ref. 10) and GRB060614 (ref. 11)
were not accompanied by supernova emission down to limits
hundreds of times fainter than the archetypal supernova SN1998bw
that accompanied GRB980425, and fainter than any type Ic
supernova ever observed$^12$. Multi-band observations of the
early afterglows, as well as spectroscopy of the host galaxies,
exclude the possibility of significant dust obscuration and show
that the bursts originated in actively star-forming regions. The
absence of a supernova to such deep limits is qualitatively
different from all previous nearby long-duration GRBs and
suggests a new phenomenological type of massive stellar death.},
