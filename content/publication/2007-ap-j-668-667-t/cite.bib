 abstract = {We examine the abundance of molecular hydrogen (H$_2$) in the spectra
of gamma ray burst afterglows (GRBs). In nearby galaxies, H$_2
$ traces the cold neutral medium (CNM) and dense molecular
star-forming interstellar gas. Although H$_2$ is detected in
at least half of all sight lines toward hot stars in the
Magellanic Clouds and in åisebox-0.5ex~25% of
damped Ly\ensuremathα systems toward quasars, it is not
detected in any of the five GRB environments with a similar
range of neutral hydrogen column density and metallicity. We
detect no vibrationally excited H$_2$ that would imply that
the GRB itself has photodissociated its parent molecular cloud,
so such models are ruled out unless the parent cloud was
&lt;\i̊sebox-0.5ex~4 pc in radius and was
fully dissociated prior to the spectroscopic observations, or
the star escaped its parent cloud during its main-sequence
lifetime. The low molecular fractions for the GRBs are
mysterious in light of their large column densities of neutral H
and expectations based on local analogs, i.e., 30 Doradus in the
LMC. This surprising lack of H$_2$ in GRB damped
Ly\ensuremathα absorbers indicates that the destruction
processes that suppress molecule formation in the LMC and SMC
are more effective in the GRB hosts, most probably due to a
combination of low metallicity and an FUV radiation field 10-100
times the Galactic mean field. These inferred conditions place
strong constraints on the star-forming regions in these early
galaxies.},
