 abstract = {The LIGO/Virgo gravitational wave events S190828j and S190828l were
detected only 21 minutes apart, from nearby regions of sky, and
with the same source classifications (binary black hole
mergers). It is therefore natural to speculate that the two
signals are actually strongly lensed images of the same merger.
However, an estimate of the separation of the (unknown)
positions of the two events requires them to be &gt;10 deg
apart, much wider than the arcsecond-scale separations that
usually arise in extragalactic lensing. The large separation is
much more consistent with two independent, unrelated events that
occurred close in time by chance. We quantify the overlap
between simulated pairs of lensed events, and use frequentist
hypothesis testing to reject S190828j/l as a lensed pair at
99.8% confidence. <P />},
