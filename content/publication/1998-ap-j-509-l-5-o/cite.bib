 abstract = {We report on Hubble Space Telescope (HST) observations of the host
galaxy of GRB 971214, taken 4 months after the burst. The
redshift of the proposed host galaxy at z=3.418, combined with
optical and radio observations of the burst afterglow, implies
the extremely large isotropic energy release from the burst in
\ensuremathγ-rays of E$_\ensuremathγ$åiseb
ox-0.5ex~3×10$^53$ ergs, some 2
orders of magnitude higher than the previously commonly assumed
numbers. The positional offset between the optical transient
observed at the Keck telescope and the centroid of the proposed
host galaxy in the HST image is 0.14``+/-0.07''. We find no
evidence in our deep HST image for a chance foreground galaxy
superposed along the line of sight to the proposed host at
z=3.418. The morphology and photometric properties of this
galaxy, such as the total flux, morphology, radial surface
profile, and scale length, are typical as compared to other,
spectroscopically confirmed z&gt;=3 galaxies. <P />Based on
observations with the NASA/ESA Hubble Space Telescope obtained
at the Space Telescope Science Institute, which is operated by
AURA, Inc., under NASA contract NAS 5-26555 and on observations
obtained at the W. M. Keck Observatory, which is operated
jointly by the California Institute of Technology and the
University of California.},
