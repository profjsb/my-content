 abstract = {Stars of late-M and L spectral types, collectively known as ultracool
dwarfs (UCDs), may be excellent targets for searches for
extrasolar planets. Owing to their small radii, the signal from
an Earth-size planet transiting a UCD is, in principle, readily
detectable. We present results from a study designed to evaluate
the feasibility of using precise near-infrared (NIR) photometry
to detect terrestrial extrasolar planets orbiting UCDs. We used
the Peters Automated Infrared Imaging Telescope (PAIRITEL) to
observe a sample of 13 UCDs over a period of 10 months. We
consider several important systematic effects in NIR
differential photometry and develop techniques for generating
photometry with a precision of 0.01 mag and long-term stability.
We simulate the planet detection efficiency of an extended
campaign to monitor a large sample of UCDs with PAIRITEL. We
find that both a targeted campaign with a single telescope
lasting several years and a campaign making use of a network of
telescopes distributed in longitude could provide significant
sensitivity to terrestrial planets orbiting UCDs, potentially in
the habitable zone.},
