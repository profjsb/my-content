 abstract = {We constructed a photometrically calibrated catalog of non-variable
sources from the Palomar Transient Factory (PTF) observations.
The first version of this catalog presented here, the PTF
photometric catalog 1.0, contains calibrated R$_PTF$-filter
magnitudes for \ensuremath≈2.1 × 10$^7$
sources brighter than magnitude 19, over an area of
\ensuremath≈11,233 deg$^2$. The magnitudes are
provided in the PTF photometric system, and the color of a
source is required in order to convert these magnitudes into
other magnitude systems. We estimate that the magnitudes in this
catalog have a typical accuracy of about 0.02 mag with respect
to magnitudes from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. The median
repeatability of our catalog\textquoterights magnitudes for
stars between 15 and 16 mag, is about 0.01 mag and it is over
0.03 mag for 95% of the sources in this magnitude range. The
main goal of this catalog is to provide reference magnitudes for
photometric calibration of visible light observations.
Subsequent versions of this catalog, which will be published
incrementally online, will be extended to cover a larger sky
area and will also include g$_PTF$-filter magnitudes, as well
as variability and proper-motion information.},
