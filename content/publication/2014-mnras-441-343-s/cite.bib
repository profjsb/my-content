 abstract = {Next-generation synoptic photometric surveys will yield unprecedented
(for the astronomical community) volumes of data and the
processes of discovery and rare-object identification are, by
necessity, becoming more autonomous. Such autonomous searches
can be used to find objects of interest applicable to a wide
range of outstanding problems in astronomy, and in this paper we
present the methods and results of a largely autonomous search
for highly eccentric detached eclipsing binary systems in the
Machine-learned All-Sky Automated Survey Classification Catalog.
106 detached eclipsing binaries with eccentricities of e
\ensuremath\gtrsim 0.1 are presented, most of which are
identified here for the first time. We also present new radial-
velocity curves and absolute parameters for six of those systems
with the long-term goal of increasing the number of highly
eccentric systems with orbital solutions, thereby facilitating
further studies of the tidal circularization process in binary
stars.},
