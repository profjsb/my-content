 abstract = {The first gamma-ray burst (GRB) confirmed to be bright enough to be seen
with the naked eye, GRB 080319B at redshift z = 0.937, allowed
for exquisite follow-up observations across the electromagnetic
spectrum. We present our detailed optical and infrared (IR)
observations of the afterglow, consisting of over 5000 images
starting 51 s after the GRB trigger, in concert with our own
analysis of the Swift UVOT, Burst Alert Telescope (BAT), and XRT
data. The event is extreme not only in observed properties but
also intrinsically: it was the most luminous event ever recorded
at optical and IR wavelengths and had an exceedingly high
isotropic-equivalent energy release in
\ensuremathγ-rays. At early times, the afterglow
evolution is broadly consistent with being reverse-shock
dominated, but then is subsumed by a forward shock at around
1000 s. The overall spectral energy distribution, spanning from
ultraviolet through near-IR wavelengths, shows no evidence for a
significant amount of dust extinction in the host frame. The
afterglow evolution, however, is highly chromatic: starting at
about 1000 s the index shifts blueward before shifting back to
the red at late times. In our deepest late-time observations, we
find tentative evidence for an optical jet break and a luminous
supernova. Finally, we examine the detectability of such events
with current and future facilities and find that such an event
could be detected in gamma rays by BAT out to z = 10.7
(8\ensuremathσ), while the nominal EXIST sensitivity
would allow detection to z \ensuremath≈ 32. At the K
band, this source would have been easily detected with meter-
class telescopes to z \ensuremath≈ 17.},
