 abstract = {We study the chemical abundances of the interstellar medium surrounding
high-z gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) through analysis of the damped
Ly\ensuremathα systems (DLAs) identified in afterglow
spectra. These GRB DLAs are characterized by large H I column
densities N$_HI$ and metallicities [M/H] spanning 1/100 to
nearly solar, with median [M/H]&gt;-1 dex. The majority of GRB
DLAs have [M/H] values exceeding the cosmic mean metallicity of
atomic gas at z&gt;2 i.e., if anything, the GRB DLAs are biased
to larger metallicity. We also observe (1) large [Zn/Fe] values
(&gt;+0.6 dex) and subsolar Ti/Fe ratios, which imply
substantial differential depletion; (2) large
\ensuremathα/Fe ratios, suggesting nucleosynthetic
enrichment by massive stars; and (3) low C$^0$/C$^+$ ratios
(&lt;10$^-4$). Quantitatively, the observed depletion levels
and C$^0$/C$^+$ ratios of the gas are not characteristic of
cold, dense H I clouds in the Galactic interstellar medium
(ISM). We argue that the GRB DLA represents the ISM near the GRB
but not gas directly local to the GRB (e.g., its molecular cloud
or circumstellar material). We compare these observations with
DLAs intervening in background quasars (QSO DLAs). The GRB DLAs
exhibit larger N$_HI$ values, higher \ensuremathα/Fe
and Zn/Fe ratios, and higher metallicity than the QSO DLAs.
Although these differences are statistically significant, the
offsets are relatively modest (N$_HI$ excepted). We argue that
the differences result primarily from galactocentric radius-
dependent differences in the ISM: GRB DLAs preferentially probe
denser, more depleted, higher metallicity gas located in the
inner few kiloparsecs, whereas QSO DLAs are more likely to
intersect the less dense, less enriched, outer regions of the
galaxy. Finally, we investigate whether dust obscuration may
exclude GRB DLA sight lines from QSO DLA samples; we find that
the majority of GRB DLAs would be recovered, which implies
little observational bias against large N$_HI$ systems.},
