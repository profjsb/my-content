 abstract = {We present near-infrared (NIR) time-series spectroscopy, as well as
complementary ultraviolet (UV), optical, and NIR data, of the
Type Ia supernova (SN Ia) iPTF13ebh, which was discovered within
two days from the estimated time of explosion. The first NIR
spectrum was taken merely 2.3 days after explosion and may be
the earliest NIR spectrum yet obtained of a SN Ia. The most
striking features in the spectrum are several NIR C i lines, and
the C i\ensuremathłambda1.0693 \ensuremathμm line is
the strongest ever observed in a SN Ia. Interestingly, no strong
optical C ii counterparts were found, even though the optical
spectroscopic time series began early and is densely cadenced.
Except at the very early epochs, within a few days from the time
of explosion, we show that the strong NIR C i compared to the
weaker optical C ii appears to be general in SNe Ia. iPTF13ebh
is a fast decliner with \ensuremathΔm$_15$(B) = 1.79
\ensuremath± 0.01, and its absolute magnitude obeys the
linear part of the width-luminosity relation. It is therefore
categorized as a ``transitional'' event, on the fast-declining
end of normal SNe Ia as opposed to subluminous/91bg-like
objects. iPTF13ebh shows NIR spectroscopic properties that are
distinct from both the normal and subluminous/91bg-like classes,
bridging the observed characteristics of the two classes. These
NIR observations suggest that composition and density of the
inner core are similar to that of 91bg-like events, and that it
has a deep-reaching carbon burning layer that is not observed in
more slowly declining SNe Ia. There is also a substantial
difference between the explosion times inferred from the early-
time light curve and the velocity evolution of the Si
ii\ensuremathłambda0.6355 \ensuremathμm line,
implying a long dark phase of åisebox-0.5ex~4
days. <P />This paper includes data gathered with the 6.5-m
