 abstract = {From the first two seasons of the Palomar Transient Factory, we identify
three peculiar transients (PTF 09dav, PTF 10iuv, and PTF 11bij)
with five distinguishing characteristics: peak luminosity in the
gap between novae and supernovae (M$_R$ \ensuremath≈
-15.5 to -16.5 mag), rapid photometric evolution (t $_rise$
\ensuremath≈ 12-15 days), large photospheric
velocities (\ensuremath≈6000-11,000 km s$^-1$),
early spectroscopic evolution into nebular phase
(\ensuremath≈1-3 months), and peculiar nebular spectra
dominated by calcium. We also culled the extensive decade-long
Lick Observatory Supernova Search database and identified an
additional member of this group, SN 2007ke. Our choice of
photometric and spectroscopic properties was motivated by SN
2005E (Perets et al.). To our surprise, as in the case of SN
2005E, all four members of this group are also clearly offset
from the bulk of their host galaxy. Given the well-sampled
early- and late-time light curves, we derive ejecta masses in
the range of 0.4-0.7 M $_☉$. Spectroscopically, we find that
there may be a diversity in the photospheric phase, but the
commonality is in the unusual nebular spectra. Our extensive
follow-up observations rule out standard thermonuclear and
standard core-collapse explosions for this class of ``calcium-
rich gap'' transients. If the progenitor is a white dwarf, we
are likely seeing a detonation of the white dwarf core and
perhaps even shock-front interaction with a previously ejected
nova shell. If the progenitor is a massive star, a nonstandard
channel specific to a low-metallicity environment needs to be
invoked (e.g., ejecta fallback leading to black hole formation).
Detection (or the lack thereof) of a faint underlying host
(dwarf galaxy and cluster) will provide a crucial and decisive
diagnostic to choose between these alternatives.},
