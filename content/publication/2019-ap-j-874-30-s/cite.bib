 abstract = {We have obtained repeated images of six fields toward the Galactic bulge
in five passbands (u, g, r, i, z) with the DECam imager on the
Blanco 4 m telescope at CTIO. From more than 1.6 billion
individual photometric measurements in the field centered on
Baade\textquoterights window, we have detected 4877 putative
variable stars. A total of 474 of these have been confirmed as
fundamental mode RR Lyrae stars, whose colors at minimum light
yield line-of-sight reddening determinations, as well as a
reddenning law toward the Galactic Bulge, which differs
significantly from the standard R$_V$ = 3.1 formulation.
Assuming that the stellar mix is invariant over the 3 square-
degree field, we are able to derive a line-of-sight reddening
map with sub-arcminute resolution, enabling us to obtain de-
reddened and extinction corrected color-magnitude diagrams
(CMDs) of this bulge field using up to 2.5 million well-measured
stars. The corrected CMDs show unprecedented detail and expose
sparsely populated sequences: for example, delineation of the
very wide red giant branch, structure within the red giant
clump, the full extent of the horizontal branch, and a
surprising bright feature that is likely due to stars with ages
younger than 1 Gyr. We use the RR Lyrae stars to trace the
spatial structure of the ancient stars and find an exponential
decline in density with Galactocentric distance. We discuss ways
in which our data products can be used to explore the age and
metallicity properties of the bulge, and how our larger list of
all variables is useful for learning to interpret future LSST
alerts.},
