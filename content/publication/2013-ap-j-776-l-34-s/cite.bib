 abstract = {We report the discovery of the optical afterglow of the
\ensuremathγ-ray burst (GRB) 130702A, identified upon
searching 71 deg$^2$ surrounding the Fermi Gamma-ray Burst
Monitor (GBM) localization. Discovered and characterized by the
intermediate Palomar Transient Factory, iPTF13bxl is the first
afterglow discovered solely based on a GBM localization. Real-
time image subtraction, machine learning, human vetting, and
rapid response multi-wavelength follow-up enabled us to quickly
narrow a list of 27,004 optical transient candidates to a single
afterglow-like source. Detection of a new, fading X-ray source
by Swift and a radio counterpart by CARMA and the Very Large
Array confirmed the association between iPTF13bxl and GRB
130702A. Spectroscopy with the Magellan and Palomar 200 inch
telescopes showed the afterglow to be at a redshift of z =
0.145, placing GRB 130702A among the lowest redshift GRBs
detected to date. The prompt \ensuremathγ-ray energy
release and afterglow luminosity are intermediate between
typical cosmological GRBs and nearby sub-luminous events such as
GRB 980425 and GRB 060218. The bright afterglow and emerging
supernova offer an opportunity for extensive panchromatic
follow-up. Our discovery of iPTF13bxl demonstrates the first
observational proof-of-principle for
åisebox-0.5ex~10 Fermi-iPTF localizations
annually. Furthermore, it represents an important step toward
overcoming the challenges inherent in uncovering faint optical
counterparts to comparably localized gravitational wave events
in the Advanced LIGO and Virgo era.},
