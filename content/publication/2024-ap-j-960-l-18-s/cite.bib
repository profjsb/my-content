 abstract = {We report observations of the optical counterpart of the long gamma-ray
burst (GRB) GRB 230812B and its associated supernova (SN) SN
2023pel. The proximity (z = 0.36) and high energy (E $_
\ensuremathγ,iso$ åisebox-0.5ex~
10$^53$ erg) make it an important event to study as a probe
of the connection between massive star core collapse and
relativistic jet formation. With a phenomenological power-law
model for the optical afterglow, we find a late-time flattening
consistent with the presence of an associated SN. SN 2023pel has
an absolute peak r-band magnitude of M $_ r $ = -19.46
\ensuremath± 0.18 mag (about as bright as SN 1998bw) and
evolves on quicker timescales. Using a radioactive heating
model, we derive a nickel mass powering the SN of M $_Ni$ =
0.38 \ensuremath± 0.01 M $_\ensuremathødot$ and a
peak bolometric luminosity of L $_bol$
\i̊sebox-0.5ex~ 1.3 × 10$^43$
erg s$^-1$. We confirm SN 2023pel's classification as a broad-
line Type Ic SN with a spectrum taken 15.5 days after its peak
in the r band and derive a photospheric expansion velocity of v
$_ph$ = 11,300 \ensuremath± 1600 km s$^-1$ at that
phase. Extrapolating this velocity to the time of maximum light,
we derive the ejecta mass M $_ej$ = 1.0 \ensuremath± 0.6
M $_\ensuremathødot$ and kinetic energy
$E_\mathrmKE=1.3_-1.2^+3.3\times
10^51\,\mathrmerg$ . We find that GRB 230812B/SN 2023pel
has SN properties that are mostly consistent with the overall
GRB-SN population. The lack of correlations found in the GRB-SN
population between SN brightness and E $_
\ensuremathγ,iso$ for their associated GRBs across a
broad range of 7 orders of magnitude provides further evidence
that the central engine powering the relativistic ejecta is not
coupled to the SN powering mechanism in GRB-SN systems.},
