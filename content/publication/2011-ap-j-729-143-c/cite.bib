 abstract = {We present observations and interpretation of the Type IIn supernova SN
2008am discovered by the ROTSE Supernova Verification Project
(RSVP). SN 2008am peaked at approximately -22.3 mag at a
redshift of z = 0.2338, giving it a peak luminosity of
åisebox-0.5ex~3 × 10$^44$ erg
s$^-1$ and making it one of the most luminous supernovae ever
observed. The total radiated energy is sime2 ×
10$^51$ erg. The host galaxy appears to be an SB1 of normal
luminosity (M_\r'\ ̃ -20) with metallicity
Z\i̊sebox-0.5ex~ 0.4 Z $_sun$. ROTSE upper
limits and detections constrain the rise time to be
\rs̊ebox-0.5ex~34 days in the rest frame,
significantly shorter than similar events, SN 2006gy and SN
2006tf. Photometric observations in the ultraviolet, optical,
and infrared bands (J, H, K$_s$ ) constrain the spectral
energy distribution evolution. We obtained six optical spectra
of the supernova, five on the early decline from maximum light
and a sixth nearly a year later plus a very late time spectrum
(\rae̊box-0.5ex~2 yr) of the host galaxy. The
spectra show no evidence for broad supernova photospheric
features in either absorption or emission at any phase. The
spectra of SN 2008am show strong Balmer-line and He I
\ensuremathłambda5876 emission with intermediate widths
(\raib̊ox-0.5ex~25 \rA ̊in the first
\raisex̊-0.5ex~40 days after optical maximum.
The width formally corresponds to a velocity of
\raiseb̊-0.5ex~1000 km s$^-1$. We examine a
variety of models for the line wings and conclude that multiple
scattering is most likely, implying that our spectra contain no
specific information on the bulk flow velocity. We examine a
variety of models for the ROTSE light curve subject to the rise
time and the nature of the spectra, including radioactive decay,
shocks in optically thick and optically thin circumstellar media
(CSMs) and a magnetar. The most successful model is one for
which the CSM is optically thick and in which diffusion of
forward shock-deposited luminosity gives rise to the observed
light curve. The model suggests strong mass loss and a greater
contribution from the interaction of the forward shock with
optically thick CSM than from the reverse shock. Diffusion of
the shock-deposited energy from the forward shock is found to be
important in accounting for the rising part of the light curve.
Although there are differences in detail, SN 2008am appears to
be closely related to other super-luminous Type IIn supernovae,
SN 2006gy, SN 2006tf, and perhaps SN 2008iy, that may represent
the deaths of very massive luminous-blue-variable-type
progenitors and for which the luminosity is powered by the
interaction of the ejecta with a dense CSM.},
