 abstract = {Most Type I superluminous supernovae (SLSNe-I) reported to date have
been identified by their high peak luminosities and spectra
lacking obvious signs of hydrogen. We demonstrate that these
events can be distinguished from normal-luminosity SNe
(including Type Ic events) solely from their spectra over a wide
range of light-curve phases. We use this distinction to select
19 SLSNe-I and four possible SLSNe-I from the Palomar Transient
Factory archive (including seven previously published objects).
We present 127 new spectra of these objects and combine these
with 39 previously published spectra, and we use these to
discuss the average spectral properties of SLSNe-I at different
spectral phases. We find that Mn II most probably contributes to
the ultraviolet spectral features after maximum light, and we
give a detailed study of the O II features that often
characterize the early-time optical spectra of SLSNe-I. We
discuss the velocity distribution of O II, finding that for some
SLSNe-I this can be confined to a narrow range compared to
relatively large systematic velocity shifts. Mg II and Fe II
favor higher velocities than O II and C II, and we briefly
discuss how this may constrain power-source models. We
tentatively group objects by how well they match either SN
2011ke or PTF12dam and discuss the possibility that physically
distinct events may have been previously grouped together under
the SLSN-I label.},
