 abstract = {We observed the afterglow of GRB 130427A with the Reionization and
Transients Infrared Camera (RATIR) instrument on the 1.5 m
Harold L. Johnson telescope of the Observatorio Astronómico
Nacional in Sierra San Pedro Mártir. Our homogenous griZY JH
photometry extends from the night of the burst to three years
later. We fit a model for the afterglow. There is a significant
positive residual that matches the behavior of SN 1998bw in the
griZ filters; we suggest that this is a photometric signature of
the supernova SN 2013cq associated with the Gamma-ray burst. The
peak absolute magnitude of the supernova is
\M\$_r$=-18.43+/- 0.11.},
