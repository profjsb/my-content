 abstract = {We calculate durations and spectral parameters for 207 Swift bursts
detected by the Burst Alert Telescope from 2007 April to 2009
August, including 67 events with measured redshifts. This is the
first supplement to our catalog of 425 Swift gamma-ray bursts
(GRBs; 147 with redshifts) starting from GRB 041220. This
complete and extensive data set, analyzed with a unified
methodology, allows us to conduct an accurate census of
intrinsic GRB energetics, hardnesses, durations, and redshifts.
The GRB world model we derive reproduces well the observables
from both Swift and pre-Swift satellites. Comparing to the
cosmic star formation rate, we estimate that only about 0.1% of
massive stars explode as bright GRBs. There is strong evidence
for evolution in the Swift population at intermediate and
high-z, and we can rule out (at the 5\ensuremathÏƒ
level) that this is due to evolution in the luminosity function
of GRBs. Instead, the Swift sample suggests a modest propensity
for low metallicity, evidenced by an increase in the rate
density with redshift. Treating the multivariate data and
selection effects rigorously, we find a real, intrinsic
correlation between E $_iso$ and E $_pk$ (and possibly also
T $_ r45,z $); however, the correlation is not a narrow log-
log relation and its observed appearance is strongly detector-
dependent. We also estimate the high-z rate (3%-9% of GRBs at
z beyond 5) and discuss the extent of a large missing population
of low-E $_pk,obs$ X-ray flashes as well as a potentially
large missing population of short-duration GRBs that will be
probed by EXIST.},
