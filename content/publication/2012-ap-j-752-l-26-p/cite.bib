 abstract = {The nearby Type Ia supernova (SN Ia) SN 2011fe in M101 (cz = 241 km
s$^-1$) provides a unique opportunity to study the early
evolution of a ``normal'' SN Ia, its compositional structure,
and its elusive progenitor system. We present 18 high signal-to-
noise spectra of SN 2011fe during its first month beginning 1.2
days post-explosion and with an average cadence of 1.8 days.
This gives a clear picture of how various line-forming species
are distributed within the outer layers of the ejecta, including
that of unburned material (C+O). We follow the evolution of C II
absorption features until they diminish near maximum light,
showing overlapping regions of burned and unburned material
between ejection velocities of 10,000 and 16,000 km s$^-1$.
This supports the notion that incomplete burning, in addition to
progenitor scenarios, is a relevant source of spectroscopic
diversity among SNe Ia. The observed evolution of the highly
Doppler-shifted O I \ensuremath≈Çambda7774 absorption
features detected within 5 days post-explosion indicates the
presence of O I with expansion velocities from 11,500 to 21,000
km s$^-1$. The fact that some O I is present above C II
suggests that SN 2011fe may have had an appreciable amount of
unburned oxygen within the outer layers of the ejecta.},
