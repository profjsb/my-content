 abstract = {We report spectroscopic and photometric observations of the Type IIb SN
2011dh obtained between 4 and 34 days after the estimated date
of explosion (May 31.5 UT). The data cover a wide wavelength
range from 2000 ̊A in the ultraviolet (UV) to 2.4
\ensuremathμm in the near-infrared (NIR). Optical spectra
provide line profiles and velocity measurements of H I, He I, Ca
II, and Fe II that trace the composition and kinematics of the
supernova (SN). NIR spectra show that helium is present in the
atmosphere as early as 11 days after the explosion. A UV
spectrum obtained with the Space Telescope Imaging Spectrograph
reveals that the UV flux for SN 2011dh is low compared to other
SN IIb. Modeling the spectrum with SYNOW suggests that the UV
deficit is due to line blanketing from Ti II and Co II. The H I
and He I velocities in SN 2011dh are separated by about 4000 km
s$^-1$ at all phases. A velocity gap is consistent with models
for a preexplosion structure in which a hydrogen-rich shell
surrounds the progenitor. We estimate that the H shell of SN
2011dh is \ensuremath≈8 times less massive than the
shell of SN 1993J and \ensuremath≈3 times more massive
than the shell of SN 2008ax. Light curves (LCs) for 12 passbands
are presented: UVW2, UVM2, UVW1, U, u', B, V, r', i', J, H, and
K$_s$ . In the B band, SN 2011dh reached peak brightness of
13.17 mag at 20.0 \ensuremath± 0.5 after the explosion.
The maximum bolometric luminosity of 1.8 \ensuremath± 0.2
× 10$^42$ erg s$^-1$ occurred
\ensuremath≈22 days after the explosion. NIR emission
provides more than 30% of the total bolometric flux at the
beginning of our observations, and the NIR contribution
increases to nearly 50% of the total by day 34. The UV produces
16% of the total flux on day 4, 5% on day 9, and 1% on day
34. We compare the bolometric LCs of SN 2011dh, SN 2008ax, and
SN 1993J. The LC are very different for the first 12 days after
the explosions, but all three SN IIb display similar peak
luminosities, times of peak, decline rates, and colors after
maximum. This suggests that the progenitors of these SN IIb may
have had similar compositions and masses, but they exploded
inside hydrogen shells that have a wide range of masses. SN
2011dh was well observed, and a likely progenitor star has been
identified in preexplosion images. The detailed observations
presented here will help evaluate theoretical models for this SN
and lead to a better understanding of SN IIb.},
