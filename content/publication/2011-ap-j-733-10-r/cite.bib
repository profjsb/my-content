 abstract = {With the coming data deluge from synoptic surveys, there is a need for
frameworks that can quickly and automatically produce calibrated
classification probabilities for newly observed variables based
on small numbers of time-series measurements. In this paper, we
introduce a methodology for variable-star classification,
drawing from modern machine-learning techniques. We describe how
to homogenize the information gleaned from light curves by
selection and computation of real-numbered metrics (features),
detail methods to robustly estimate periodic features, introduce
tree-ensemble methods for accurate variable-star classification,
and show how to rigorously evaluate a classifier using cross
validation. On a 25-class data set of 1542 well-studied variable
stars, we achieve a 22.8% error rate using the random forest
(RF) classifier; this represents a 24% improvement over the
best previous classifier on these data. This methodology is
effective for identifying samples of specific science classes:
for pulsational variables used in Milky Way tomography we obtain
a discovery efficiency of 98.2% and for eclipsing systems we
find an efficiency of 99.1%, both at 95% purity. The RF
classifier is superior to other methods in terms of accuracy,
speed, and relative immunity to irrelevant features; the RF can
also be used to estimate the importance of each feature in
classification. Additionally, we present the first astronomical
use of hierarchical classification methods to incorporate a
known class taxonomy in the classifier, which reduces the
catastrophic error rate from 8% to 7.8%. Excluding low-
amplitude sources, the overall error rate improves to 14%, with
a catastrophic error rate of 3.5%.},
