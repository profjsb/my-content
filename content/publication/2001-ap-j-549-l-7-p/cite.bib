 abstract = {We present multicolor light curves of the optical afterglow of gamma-ray
burst (GRB) 000926. Beginning
åisebox-0.5ex~1.5 days after the burst, the
light curves of this GRB steepen measurably. The existence of
such achromatic breaks is usually taken to be an important
observational signature that the ejecta are not expanding
isotropically but rather have a collimated jetlike geometry. If
we interpret the data in this context, we derive an opening
angle of 5°, which reduces the energy release
compared with an isotropic model by a factor of
\i̊sebox-0.5ex~275, to
1.7×10$^51$ ergs. To fit the data with a simple
jet model requires extinction along the line of sight. The
derived A$_V$ is in the range 0.11-0.82 mag, depending on the
adopted extinction law and whether the electrons giving rise to
the optical emission are undergoing synchrotron cooling or not.
Since this is in excess of the expected extinction from our
Galaxy, we attribute this to the GRB host. We note that this
extinction is typical of a galactic disk, and therefore the
event likely took place in the disk of its host.},
