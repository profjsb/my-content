 abstract = {We report optical spectroscopic observations of a sample of 6 low-
galactic latitude microquasar candidates selected by cross-
identification of X-ray and radio point source catalogs for
|b$^II$ | \ensuremathłeq 5 °. Two objects
resulted to be of clear extragalactic origin, as an obvious
cosmologic redshift has been measured from their emission lines.
For the rest, none exhibits a clear stellar-like spectrum as
would be expected for genuine Galactic microquasars. Their
featureless spectra are consistent with being extragalactic in
origin although two of them could be also highly reddened stars.
The apparent non-confirmation of our candidates suggests that
the population of persistent microquasar systems in the Galaxy
is more rare than previously believed. If none of them is
galactic, the upper limit to the space density of new
<ASTROBJ>Cygnus X-3</ASTROBJ>-like microquasars within 15 kpc
would be ła1.1 × 10$^-12$ pc$^-3$. A similar
upper limit for new <ASTROBJ>LS 5039</ASTROBJ>-like systems
within 4 kpc is estimated to be ła5.6 × 10$^-11$
pc$^-3$.},
