 abstract = {Inference on time series data is a common requirement in many scientific
disciplines and internet of things (IoT) applications, yet there
are few resources available to domain scientists to easily,
robustly, and repeatably build such complex inference workflows:
traditional statistical models of time series are often too
rigid to explain complex time domain behavior, while popular
machine learning packages require already-featurized dataset
inputs. Moreover, the software engineering tasks required to
instantiate the computational platform are daunting. cesium is
an end-to-end time series analysis framework, consisting of a
Python library as well as a web front-end interface, that allows
researchers to featurize raw data and apply modern machine
learning techniques in a simple, reproducible, and extensible
way. Users can apply out-of-the-box feature engineering
workflows as well as save and replay their own analyses. Any
steps taken in the front end can also be exported to a Jupyter
notebook, so users can iterate between possible models within
the front end and then fine-tune their analysis using the
additional capabilities of the back-end library. The open-source
packages make us of many use modern Python toolkits, including
xarray, dask, Celery, Flask, and scikit-learn. <P />},
