 abstract = {R. J. Foley, J. S. Bloom, D. Kocevski, D. Perley, and A. V. Filippenko,
University of California, Berkeley, report that inspection of
CCD spectra (range 350-930 nm), obtained on May 30 UT with the
Keck I 10-m telescope (+ LRIS), shows that SN 2006cb (cf. IAUC
8709) is of type Ib, approximately 4-6 weeks after maximum
light; absorption lines of He I are prominent. The spectrum of
2006co (cf. CBET 523) shows it to be a young type-II supernova,
having a blue continuum with hydrogen Balmer lines superposed.
Removing the recession velocity of 4030 km/s, derived from H-II-
region emission lines, we find the minimum of the H-beta
absorption to be blueshifted by 12300 km/s. Spectrograms
obtained on May 31 shows that SN 2006cq (cf. CBET 527) is of
type Ia, with a spectral-feature age (Riess et al. 1997, A.J.
114, 722) of -1.7 +/- 2 days relative to maximum brightness;
adopting the recession velocity of 14500 km/s (Rines et al.
2003, A.J. 126, 2152), the minimum of the Si II 635.5-nm line is
found to be blueshifted by 10700 km/s.},
