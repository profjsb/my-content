 abstract = {Analyses of supernovae (SNe) have revealed two main types of
progenitors: exploding white dwarfs and collapsing massive
stars. Here we describe SN 2002bj, which stands out as different
from any SN reported to date. Its light curve rose and declined
very rapidly, yet reached a peak intrinsic brightness greater
than -18 magnitude. A spectrum obtained 7 days after discovery
shows the presence of helium and intermediate-mass elements, yet
no clear hydrogen or iron-peak elements. The spectrum only
barely resembles that of a type Ia SN, with added carbon and
helium. Its properties suggest that SN 2002bj may be
representative of a class of progenitors that previously has
been only hypothesized: a helium detonation on a white dwarf,
ejecting a small envelope of material. New surveys should find
many such objects, despite their scarcity.},
