 abstract = {B. R. Oppenheimer, J. S. Bloom, S. S. Eikenberry, and K. Matthews,
California Institute of Technology, communicate: ``We have
obtained narrowband 2.2-micron images of the proposed infrared
counterpart to SGR 1900+14 (Vrba et al. 1996, Ap.J. 468, 225) on
June 3.486 UT, 4.1 days after the recent bursting activity
reported on IAUC 6929. Differential photometry of stars 'A' and
'B' (the double M stars) and star 'C' of Vrba et al. yields
m_A-m_B = +0.4 +/- 0.1 and m_A-m_C = +4.5 +/- 0.2 mag,
consistent with the measurements of Vrba et al. Over the course
of 10 min (ten separate frames), no variability was detected in
the double M stars to a limit of 0.1 mag.'' <P />},
