 abstract = {Long-duration \ensuremathγ-ray bursts (GRBs) are thought to
result from the explosions of certain massive stars, and some
are bright enough that they should be observable out to
redshifts of z&gt;20 using current technology. Hitherto, the
highest redshift measured for any object was z = 6.96, for a
Lyman-\ensuremathα emitting galaxy. Here we report that
GRB090423 lies at a redshift of
zåisebox-0.5ex~8.2, implying that massive
stars were being produced and dying as GRBs
\i̊sebox-0.5ex~630Myr after the Big Bang. The
burst also pinpoints the location of its host galaxy.},
