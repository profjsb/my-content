 abstract = {Stars with initial masses such that 10&lt;=M$_initial$&lt;=100,
where is the solar mass, fuse progressively heavier elements in
their centres, until the core is inert iron. The core then
gravitationally collapses to a neutron star or a black hole,
leading to an explosion-an iron-core-collapse supernova. By
contrast, extremely massive stars with M$_initial$&gt;=140
(if such exist) develop oxygen cores with masses, M$_core$,
that exceed 50, where high temperatures are reached at
relatively low densities. Conversion of energetic, pressure-
supporting photons into electron-positron pairs occurs before
oxygen ignition and leads to a violent contraction which
triggers a nuclear explosion that unbinds the star in a pair-
instability supernova. Transitional objects with
100&lt;M$_initial$&lt;140 may end up as iron-core-collapse
supernovae following violent mass ejections, perhaps as a result
of brief episodes of pair instability, and may already have been
identified. Here we report observations of supernova SN2007bi, a
luminous, slowly evolving object located within a dwarf galaxy.
We estimate the exploding core mass to be
M$_core$Ã¥isebox-0.5ex~100, in which case
theory unambiguously predicts a pair-instability supernova. We
show that &gt;3 of radioactive $^56$Ni was synthesized during
the explosion and that our observations are well fitted by
models of pair-instability supernovae. This indicates that
nearby dwarf galaxies probably host extremely massive stars,
above the apparent Galactic stellar mass limit, which perhaps
result from processes similar to those that created the first
stars in the Universe.},
