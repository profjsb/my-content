 abstract = {Excited Si$^+$ and Fe$^+$ species are routinely observed in the host
environment of gamma-ray burst (GRB) afterglows but are not
commonly seen in other extragalactic locations. Their presence
signals unusual properties in the gaseous environment of these
GRB hosts that arise either as a result of the intense ionizing
radiation of the afterglow or through collision excitation in a
dense cloud. In particular, the photon pumping scenario has
explicit expectations for temporal variation in the strength of
the excited lines, owing to the decline in the ionizing flux of
the GRB afterglow. We analyze afterglow spectra of GRB 020813
obtained in two epochs åisebox-0.5ex~16 hr
apart and examine transitions from the first excited state of
Fe$^+$ at J=7/2 in these two sets of data. We report a
significant decline by at least a factor of 5 in the equivalent
width of the Fe II \ensuremathłambda2396 transition, the
strongest from the J=7/2 state. We perform a Monte Carlo
analysis and determine that this temporal variation is present
at more than 3 \ensuremathσ level of significance. This
observation represents the first detection in the temporal
variation of the excited Fe$^+$ states in the GRB host
interstellar medium, a direct influence of the burst itself on
its environment. We further estimate that the Fe$^+$ gas
resides 50-100 pc from the afterglow, based on the afterglow
light curve and the presence and absence of the excited Fe II
\ensuremathłambda2396 in the two-epoch observations.},
