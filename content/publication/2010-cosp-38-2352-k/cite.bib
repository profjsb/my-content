 abstract = {The IRT is a 1.1m visible and infrared passively cooled telescope, which
can locate, identify and obtain spectra of GRB afterglows at
redshifts up to z 20. It will also acquire optical-IR imaging
and spectroscopy of AGN and transients discovered by the EXIST
(The Energetic X-ray Imaging Survey Telescope). The IRT imaging
and spectroscopic capabilities cover a broad spectral range from
0.32.2m in four bands. The identical fields of view in the four
instrument bands are each split in three subfields: imaging,
objective prism slitless for the field and objective prism
single object slit low resolution spectroscopy, and high
resolution long slit on single object. This allows the
instrument to do simultaneous broadband photometry or
spectroscopy of the same object over the full spectral range,
thus greatly improving the efficiency of the observatory and its
detection limits. A prompt follow up (within three minutes) of
the transient discovered by the EXIST makes IRT a unique tool
for detection and study of these events, which is particularly
valuable at wavelengths unavailable to the ground based
observatories. <P />},
