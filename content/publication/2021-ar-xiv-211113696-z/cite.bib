 abstract = {While gravitational microlensing by planetary systems can provide unique
vistas on the properties of exoplanets, observations of such
2-body microlensing events can often be explained with multiple
and distinct physical configurations, so-called model
degeneracies. An understanding of the intrinsic and exogenous
origins of different classes of degeneracy provides a foundation
for phenomenological interpretation. Here, leveraging a fast
machine-learning based inference framework, we present the
discovery of a new regime of degeneracy--the offset degeneracy--
which unifies the previously known close-wide and inner-outer
degeneracies, generalises to resonant caustics, and upon
reanalysis, is ubiquitous in previously published planetary
events with 2-fold degenerate solutions. Importantly, our
discovery suggests that the commonly reported close-wide
degeneracy essentially never arises in actual events and should,
instead, be more suitably viewed as a transition point of the
offset degeneracy. While previous studies of microlensing
degeneracies are largely studies of degenerate caustics, our
discovery demonstrates that degenerate caustics do not
necessarily result in degenerate events, which for the latter it
is more relevant to study magnifications at the location of the
source. This discovery fundamentally changes the way in which
degeneracies in planetary microlensing events should be
interpreted, suggests a deeper symmetry in the mathematics of
2-body lenses than has previously been recognised, and will
increasingly manifest itself in data from new generations of
microlensing surveys.},
