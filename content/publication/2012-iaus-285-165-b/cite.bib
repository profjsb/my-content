 abstract = {By the end of the last decade, robotic telescopes were established as
effective alternatives to the traditional role of astronomer in
planning, conducting and reducing time-domain observations. By
the end of this decade, machines will play a much more central
role in the discovery and classification of time-domain events
observed by such robots. While this abstraction of humans away
from the real-time loop (and the nightly slog of the nominal
scientific process) is inevitable, just how we will get there as
a community is uncertain. I discuss the importance of machine
learning in astronomy today, and project where we might consider
heading in the future. I will also touch on the role of people
and organisations in shaping and maximising the scientific
returns of the coming data deluge. <P />},
