 abstract = {While gravitational microlensing by planetary systems$^1,2$ provides
unique vistas on the properties of exoplanets$^3$,
observations of a given two-body microlensing event can often be
interpreted with multiple distinct physical configurations. Such
ambiguities are typically attributed to the close-wide$^4,5$
and inner-outer$^6$ types of degeneracy, which arise from
transformation invariances and symmetries of microlensing
caustics. However, there remain unexplained inconsistencies
(see, for example, ref. $^7$) between the aforementioned
theories and observations. Here, leveraging a fast machine
learning inference framework$^8$, we present the discovery of
the offset degeneracy, which concerns a magnification-matching
behaviour on the lens axis and is formulated independently of
caustics. This offset degeneracy unifies the close-wide and
inner-outer degeneracies, generalizes to resonant topologies
and, upon reanalysis, not only appears ubiquitous in previously
published planetary events with twofold degenerate solutions,
but also resolves prior inconsistencies. Our analysis
demonstrates that degenerate caustics do not strictly result in
degenerate magnifications and that the commonly invoked close-
wide degeneracy essentially never arises in actual events.
Moreover, it is shown that parameters in offset-degenerate
configurations are related by a simple expression. This suggests
the existence of a deeper symmetry in the equations governing
two-body lenses than previously recognized.},
