abstract: While gravitational microlensing by planetary systems$^1,2$ provides unique
  vistas on the properties of exoplanets$^3$, observations of a given two-body microlensing
  event can often be interpreted with multiple distinct physical configurations. Such
  ambiguities are typically attributed to the close-wide$^4,5$ and inner-outer$^6$
  types of degeneracy, which arise from transformation invariances and symmetries
  of microlensing caustics. However, there remain unexplained inconsistencies (see,
  for example, ref. $^7$) between the aforementioned theories and observations. Here,
  leveraging a fast machine learning inference framework$^8$, we present the discovery
  of the offset degeneracy, which concerns a magnification-matching behaviour on the
  lens axis and is formulated independently of caustics. This offset degeneracy unifies
  the close-wide and inner-outer degeneracies, generalizes to resonant topologies
  and, upon reanalysis, not only appears ubiquitous in previously published planetary
  events with twofold degenerate solutions, but also resolves prior inconsistencies.
  Our analysis demonstrates that degenerate caustics do not strictly result in degenerate
  magnifications and that the commonly invoked close- wide degeneracy essentially
  never arises in actual events. Moreover, it is shown that parameters in offset-degenerate
  configurations are related by a simple expression. This suggests the existence of
  a deeper symmetry in the equations governing two-body lenses than previously recognized.
