 abstract = {We present a preliminary data release from our multi-year campaign at
Keck Observatory to study the host galaxies of a large sample of
Swift-era gamma-ray bursts via multi-color ground-based optical
imaging and spectroscopy. With over 160 targets observed to date
(and almost 100 host detections, most of which have not
previously been reported in the literature) our effort
represents the broadest GRB host survey to date. While targeting
was heterogeneous, our observations span the known diversity of
GRBs including short bursts, long bursts, spectrally soft GRBs
(XRFs), ultra-energetic GRBs, X-ray faint GRBs, dark GRBs, SN-
GRBs, and other sub-classes. We also present a preview of our
database (currently available online via a convenient web
interface) including a catalog of multi-color photometry,
redshifts and line ID's. Final photometry and reduced imaging
and spectra will be available in the near future. <P />},
