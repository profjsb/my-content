 abstract = {The Type Ia supernova (SN Ia) SN 2000cx was one of the most peculiar
transients ever discovered, with a rise to maximum brightness
typical of a SN Ia, but a slower decline and a higher
photospheric temperature. 13 yr later SN 2013bh (also known as
iPTF13abc), a near identical twin, was discovered and we
obtained optical and near-infrared photometry and low-resolution
optical spectroscopy from discovery until about 1 month past
r-band maximum brightness. The spectra of both objects show
iron-group elements [Co II, Ni II, Fe II, Fe III and high-
velocity features (HVFs) of Ti II], intermediate-mass elements
(Si II, Si III and S II) and separate normal velocity features
(̃12 000 km s$^-1$) and HVFs (̃24 000 km s$^-1$) of Ca II.
Persistent absorption from Fe III and Si III, along with the
colour evolution, implies high blackbody temperatures for SNe
2013bh and 2000cx (̃12 000 K). Both objects lack narrow Na I D
absorption and exploded in the outskirts of their hosts,
indicating that the SN environments were relatively free of
interstellar or circumstellar material and may imply that the
progenitors came from a relatively old and low-metallicity
stellar population. Models of SN 2000cx, seemingly applicable to
SN 2013bh, imply the production of up to ̃1 M$_☉$ of $^56$Ni
and (4.3-5.5) × 10$^-3$ M$_☉$ of fast-moving Ca
ejecta.},
