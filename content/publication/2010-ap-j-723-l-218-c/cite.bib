 abstract = {We report the discovery of the host galaxy of Swift dark burst GRB
080607 at z $_GRB$ = 3.036. GRB 080607 is a unique case of a
highly extinguished (A$_V$ \ensuremath≈ 3 mag)
afterglow that was yet sufficiently bright for high-quality
absorption-line spectroscopy. The host galaxy is clearly
resolved in deep Hubble Space Telescope (HST) WF3/IR F160W
images and well detected in the Spitzer IRAC 3.5
\ensuremathμm and 4.5 \ensuremathμm channels, while
displaying little/no fluxes in deep optical images from Keck and
Magellan. The extremely red optical-infrared colors are
consistent with the large extinction seen in the afterglow
light, suggesting that the large amount of dust and gas surface
mass density seen along the afterglow sight line is not merely
local but likely reflects the global dust content across the
entire host galaxy. Adopting the dust properties and metallicity
of the host interstellar medium derived from studies of early-
time afterglow light and absorption-line spectroscopy, we
perform a stellar population synthesis analysis of the observed
spectral energy distribution to constrain the intrinsic
luminosity and stellar population of this dark burst host. The
host galaxy is best described by an exponentially declining star
formation rate of e-folding time \ensuremathτ = 2 Gyr and
an age of åisebox-0.5ex~2 Gyr. We also derive
an extinction-corrected star formation rate of SFR
\ensuremath≈ 125 h $^-2$ M $_sun$ yr$^-1$ and a
total stellar mass of M $_*$ \i̊sebox-0.5ex~
4 × 10$^11$ h $^-2$ M $_sun$. Our study
provides an example of massive, dusty star-forming galaxies
contributing to the \ensuremathγ-ray burst (GRB) host
galaxy population, supporting the notion that long-duration GRBs
trace the bulk of cosmic star formation. <P />Based in part on
