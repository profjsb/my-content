 abstract = {Swift captured for the first time a smoothly rising X-ray re-brightening
of clear non-flaring origin after the steep decay in a long
gamma-ray burst (GRB): GRB081028. A rising phase is likely
present in all GRBs but is usually hidden by the prompt tail
emission and constitutes the first manifestation of what is
later to give rise to the shallow decay phase. Contemporaneous
optical observations reveal a rapid evolution of the injection
frequency of a fast cooling synchrotron spectrum through the
optical band, which disfavours the afterglow onset (start of the
forward shock emission along our line of sight when the outflow
is decelerated) as the origin of the observed re-brightening. We
investigate alternative scenarios and find that the observations
are consistent with the predictions for a narrow jet viewed off-
axis. The high on-axis energy budget implied by this
interpretation suggests different physical origins of the prompt
and (late) afterglow emission. Strong spectral softening takes
place from the prompt to the steep decay phase: we track the
evolution of the spectral peak energy from the
\ensuremathγ-rays to the X-rays and highlight the
problems of the high latitude and adiabatic cooling
interpretations. Notably, a softening of both the high and low
spectral slopes with time is also observed. We discuss the low
on-axis radiative efficiency of GRB081028 comparing its
properties against a sample of Swift long GRBs with secure
E$_\ensuremathγ,iso$ measurements.},
