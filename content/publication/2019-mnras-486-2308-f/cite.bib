 abstract = {We present the volumetric rate of normal type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia)
discovered by the Palomar Transient Factory (PTF). Using strict
data-quality cuts, and considering only periods when the PTF
maintained a regular cadence, PTF discovered 90 SNe Ia at z
\ensuremathłeq 0.09 in a well-controlled sample over three
years of operation (2010-2012). We use this to calculate the
volumetric rate of SN Ia events by comparing this sample to
simulations of hundreds of millions of SN Ia light curves
produced in statistically representative realizations of the PTF
survey. This quantifies the recovery efficiency of each PTF SN
Ia event, and thus the relative weighting of each event. From
this, the volumetric SN Ia rate was found to be r_
v=2.43\ensuremath± 0.29
(stat)_\-0.19\\̂+0.33\(sys)× 10\-̂5\ \SNe
yr\\^1̂\ Mpc\^\\̂ h_\70\$^3$. This represents the
most precise local measurement of the SN Ia rate. We fit a
simple SN Ia delay-time distribution model,
\ensuremath∝ t$^-\ensuremathβ$, to our PTF
rate measurement combined with a literature sample of rate
measurements from surveys at higher redshifts. We find
\ensuremathβ ̃ 1, consistent with a progenitor channel
governed by the gravitational inspiral of binary white dwarfs.},
