 abstract = {We present optical and near-infrared (NIR) photometry of 28 gamma-ray
bursts (GRBs) detected by the Swift satellite and rapidly
observed by the Reionization and Transients Infrared/Optical
(RATIR) camera. We compare the optical flux at fiducial times of
5.5 and 11 h after the high-energy trigger to that in the X-ray
regime to quantify optical darkness. 46 \ensuremath± 9 per
cent (13/28) of all bursts in our sample and 55
\ensuremath± 10 per cent (13/26) of long GRBs are
optically dark, which is statistically consistently with
previous studies. Fitting RATIR optical and NIR spectral energy
distributions of 19 GRBs, most (6/7) optically dark GRBs either
occur at high redshift (z &gt; 4.5) or have a high dust content
in their host galaxies (A$_V$ &gt; 0.3). Performing
Kolmogorov-Smirnov tests, we compare the RATIR sample to those
previously presented in the literature, finding our
distributions of redshift, optical darkness, host dust
extinction and X-ray-derived column density to be consistent.
The one reported discrepancy is with host galaxy dust content in
the BAT6 sample, which appears inconsistent with our sample and
other previous literature. Comparing X-ray-derived host galaxy
hydrogen column densities to host galaxy dust extinction, we
find that GRBs tend to occur in host galaxies with a higher
metal-to-dust ratio than our own Galaxy, more akin to the Large
and Small Magellanic Clouds. Finally, to mitigate time evolution
of optical darkness, we measure \ensuremathβ$_OX,
rest$ at a fixed rest-frame time, t$_rest$ = 1.5 h and fixed
rest-frame energies in the X-ray and optical regimes. Choosing
to evaluate optical flux at \ensuremathłambda$_rest$ =
0.25 \ensuremathμm, we remove high redshift as a source of
optical darkness, demonstrating that optical darkness must
result from either high redshift, dust content in the host
galaxy along the GRB sight line, or a combination of the two.},
