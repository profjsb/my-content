abstract: We present analysis of the light curves (LCs) of 77 hydrogen-poor superluminous
  supernovae (SLSNe I) discovered during the Zwicky Transient Facility Phase I operation.
  We find that the majority (67%) of the sample can be fit equally well by both magnetar
  and ejecta-circumstellar medium (CSM) interaction plus $^56$Ni decay models. This
  implies that LCs alone cannot unambiguously constrain the physical power sources
  for an SLSN I. However, 23% of the sample show inverted V-shape, steep-declining
  LCs or features of long rise and fast post-peak decay, which are better described
  by the CSM+Ni model. The remaining 10% of the sample favors the magnetar model.
  Moreover, our analysis shows that the LC undulations are quite common, with a fraction
  of 18%-44% in our gold sample. Among those strongly undulating events, about 62%
  of them are found to be CSM-favored, implying that the undulations tend to occur
  in the CSM-favored events. Undulations show a wide range in energy and duration,
  with median values (and 1Ïƒ errors) being as $1.7 % _-0.7 % ^+1.5 % ,E_mathrmrad,mathrmtotal$
  and $28.8_-9.1^+14.4$ days, respectively. Our analysis of the undulation timescales
  suggests that intrinsic temporal variations of the central engine can explain half
  of the undulating events, while CSM interaction (CSI) can account for the majority
  of the sample. Finally, all of the well-observed He-rich SLSNe Ib either have strongly
  undulating LCs or the LCs are much better fit by the CSM+Ni model. These observations
  imply that their progenitor stars have not had enough time to lose all of the He-envelopes
  before supernova explosions, and H-poor CSM are likely to present in these events.
