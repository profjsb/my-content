 abstract = {We present analysis of the light curves (LCs) of 77 hydrogen-poor
superluminous supernovae (SLSNe I) discovered during the Zwicky
Transient Facility Phase I operation. We find that the majority
(67%) of the sample can be fit equally well by both magnetar
and ejecta-circumstellar medium (CSM) interaction plus $^56$Ni
decay models. This implies that LCs alone cannot unambiguously
constrain the physical power sources for an SLSN I. However,
23% of the sample show inverted V-shape, steep-declining LCs or
features of long rise and fast post-peak decay, which are better
described by the CSM+Ni model. The remaining 10% of the sample
favors the magnetar model. Moreover, our analysis shows that the
LC undulations are quite common, with a fraction of 18%-44% in
our gold sample. Among those strongly undulating events, about
62% of them are found to be CSM-favored, implying that the
undulations tend to occur in the CSM-favored events. Undulations
show a wide range in energy and duration, with median values
(and 1\ensuremathÏƒ errors) being as $1.7 % _-0.7 %
^+1.5 % \,E_\mathrmrad,\mathrmtotal$ and
$28.8_-9.1^+14.4$ days, respectively. Our analysis of the
undulation timescales suggests that intrinsic temporal
variations of the central engine can explain half of the
undulating events, while CSM interaction (CSI) can account for
the majority of the sample. Finally, all of the well-observed
He-rich SLSNe Ib either have strongly undulating LCs or the LCs
are much better fit by the CSM+Ni model. These observations
imply that their progenitor stars have not had enough time to
lose all of the He-envelopes before supernova explosions, and
H-poor CSM are likely to present in these events.},
