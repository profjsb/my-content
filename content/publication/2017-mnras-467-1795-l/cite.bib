 abstract = {We present the results of a Hubble Space Telescope WFC3/F160W Snapshot
survey of the host galaxies of 39 long-duration gamma-ray bursts
(LGRBs) at z &lt; 3. We have non-detections of hosts at the
locations of four bursts. Sufficient accuracy to astrometrically
align optical afterglow images and determine the location of the
LGRB within its host was possible for 31/35 detected hosts. In
agreement with other work, we find the luminosity distribution
of LGRB hosts is significantly fainter than that of a star
formation rate-weighted field galaxy sample over the same
redshift range, indicating LGRBs are not unbiasedly tracing the
star formation rate. Morphologically, the sample of LGRB hosts
is dominated by spiral-like or irregular galaxies. We find
evidence for evolution of the population of LGRB hosts towards
lower luminosity, higher concentrated hosts at lower redshifts.
Their half-light radii are consistent with other LGRB host
samples where measurements were made on rest-frame UV
observations. In agreement with recent work, we find their 80
per cent enclosed flux radii distribution to be more extended
than previously thought, making them intermediate between core-
collapse supernova (CCSN) and superluminous supernova (SLSN)
hosts. The galactocentric projected-offset distribution confirms
LGRBs as centrally concentrated, much more so than CCSNe and
similar to SLSNe. LGRBs are strongly biased towards the brighter
regions in their host light distributions, regardless of their
offset. We find a correlation between the luminosity of the LGRB
explosion site and the intrinsic column density, N$_H$,
towards the burst.},
