 abstract = {We present pre- and post-outburst observations of the new FU Orionis-
like young stellar object PTF 10qpf (also known as
LkH\ensuremathα 188-G4 and HBC 722). Prior to this
outburst, LkH\ensuremathα 188-G4 was classified as a
classical T Tauri star (CTTS) on the basis of its optical
emission-line spectrum superposed on a K8-type photosphere and
its photometric variability. The mid-infrared spectral index of
LkH\ensuremathα 188-G4 indicates a Class II-type
object. LkH\ensuremathα 188-G4 exhibited a steady rise
by åisebox-0.5ex~1 mag over
\i̊sebox-0.5ex~11 months starting in August
2009, before a subsequent more abrupt rise of &gt;3 mag on a
timescale of \rs̊ebox-0.5ex~2 months.
Observations taken during the eruption exhibit the defining
characteristics of FU Orionis variables: (1) an increase in
brightness by gsim4 mag, (2) a bright optical/near-infrared
reflection nebula appeared, (3) optical spectra are consistent
with a G supergiant and dominated by absorption lines, the only
exception being H\ensuremathα which is characterized by
a P Cygni profile, (4) near-infrared spectra resemble those of
late K-M giants/supergiants with enhanced absorption seen in the
molecular bands of CO and H$_2$O, and (5) outflow signatures
in H and He are seen in the form of blueshifted absorption
profiles. LkH\ensuremathα 188-G4 is the first member of
the FU Orionis-like class with a well-sampled optical to mid-
infrared spectral energy distribution in the pre-outburst phase.
The association of the PTF 10qpf outburst with the previously
identified CTTS LkH\ensuremathα 188-G4 (HBC 722)
provides strong evidence that FU Orionis-like eruptions
represent periods of enhanced disk accretion and outflow, likely
triggered by instabilities in the disk. The early identification
of PTF 10qpf as an FU Orionis-like variable will enable detailed
photometric and spectroscopic observations during its post-
outburst evolution for comparison with other known outbursting
objects.},
