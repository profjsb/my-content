 abstract = {We present an echelle spectrum of the Swift GRB 050730, obtained 4 hr
after the burst using the MIKE spectrograph on the Magellan Clay
telescope when the afterglow was at R=17.7. The spectrum reveals
a forest of absorption features superposed on a simple power-law
shaped continuum, best described as f$_\ensuremathν$(\e
nsuremathłambda)åisebox-0.5ex~\ensuremath
łambda$^\ensuremathα$ with
\ensuremathα=1.88+/-0.01 over
\ensuremathłambda=7000-9000 \Å. We identify the gamma-
ray burst (GRB) host at z$_GRB$=3.96855 based on the hydrogen
Lyman absorption series, narrow absorption lines due to heavy
ions such as O I, C II, Si II, S II, Ni II, Fe II, C IV, Si IV,
and N V, and fine-structure transitions such as O I*, O I**, Si
II*, C II*, and Fe II*. Together these transitions allow us to
study the properties of the interstellar medium (ISM) in the GRB
host. The principal results are as follows. (1) We estimate a
neutral hydrogen column density of logN(H I)=22.15+/-0.05 in the
host. (2) The associated metal lines exhibit multiple components
over a velocity range of \rs̊ebox-0.5ex~80 km
s$^-1$, with &gt;90% of the neutral gas confined in 20 km
s$^-1$. (3) Comparisons between different ionic transitions
show that the host has little or no dust depletion and has 1/100
solar metallicity. (4) The absorbing gas has much higher density
than that of intervening damped Ly\ensuremathα
absorption (DLA) systems. In addition, we report the
identification of an intervening DLA system at z$_DLA$=3.56439
with logN(H I)=20.3+/-0.1 and &lt;5% solar metallicity, a
Lyman limit system at z$_LLS$=3.02209 with logN(H
I)=19.9+/-0.1, a strong Mg II absorber at z$_MgII$=2.25313,
and a pair of Mg II absorbers at z$_MgII$=1.7731, 57 km
s$^-1$ apart. We demonstrate that rapid echelle spectroscopy
of GRB afterglows helps to reveal a wealth of information in the
ISM and the intergalactic medium along the sight line, which,
when followed up with late-time deep imaging, will allow us to
uncover a sample of distant galaxies with known ISM properties
to constrain galaxy formation models.},
