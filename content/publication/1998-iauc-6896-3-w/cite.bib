 abstract = {C. Tinney, R. Stathakis, and R. Cannon, Anglo-Australian Observatory;
and T. Galama, University of Amsterdam, report spectroscopy of
the possible supernova in the galaxy ESO 184-G82 associated with
the gamma-ray burst GRB 980425 (IAUC 6895), obtained with the
3.9-m Anglo-Australian Telescope (+ 2dF spectrograph; range
620-720 nm, resolution 0.15 nm) on May 2.74118 UT. There is weak
(EW = -0.18 nm) H-alpha emission, and possible S II emission
indicating a galaxy redshift of z = 0.0085 +/- 0.0002. <P />},
