 abstract = {We present the discovery and follow-up observations of a broad-line Type
Ic supernova (SN), PTF 10bzf (SN 2010ah), detected by the
Palomar Transient Factory (PTF) on 2010 February 23. The SN
distance is cong218 Mpc, greater than GRB 980425/SN 1998bw and
GRB 060218/SN 2006aj, but smaller than the other SNe firmly
associated with gamma-ray bursts (GRBs). We conducted a multi-
wavelength follow-up campaign with Palomar 48 inch, Palomar 60
inch, Gemini-N, Keck, Wise, Swift, the Allen Telescope Array,
Combined Array for Research in Millimeter-wave Astronomy,
Westerbork Synthesis Radio Telescope, and Expanded Very Large
Array. Here we compare the properties of PTF 10bzf with those of
SN 1998bw and other broad-line SNe. The optical luminosity and
spectral properties of PTF 10bzf suggest that this SN is
intermediate, in kinetic energy and amount of $^56$Ni, between
non-GRB-associated SNe like 2002ap or 1997ef, and GRB-associated
SNe like 1998bw. No X-ray or radio counterpart to PTF 10bzf was
detected. X-ray upper limits allow us to exclude the presence of
an underlying X-ray afterglow as luminous as that of other SN-
associated GRBs such as GRB 030329 or GRB 031203. Early-time
radio upper limits do not show evidence for mildly relativistic
ejecta. Late-time radio upper limits rule out the presence of an
underlying off-axis GRB, with energy and wind density similar to
the SN-associated GRB 030329 and GRB 031203. Finally, by
performing a search for a GRB in the time window and at the
position of PTF 10bzf, we find that no GRB in the interplanetary
network catalog could be associated with this SN.},
