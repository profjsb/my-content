 abstract = {We present early-time Keck spectroscopic observations and late-time
Hubble Space Telescope (HST) imaging of GRB 000926. The HST
images show a small offset between the optical transient and a
bright, compact knot in the host galaxy. Combined with the large
equivalent widths measured for metallic absorption lines by the
Keck Echellette Spectrograph and Imager (ESI) and the Low
Resolution Imaging Spectrometer, this indicates that the GRB
exploded inside a region of high stellar density. The ESI
spectroscopy reveals two absorption systems centered at
z=2.0379+/-0.0008 with a velocity separation of 168 km s$^-1$,
which we interpret as being due to individual features in the
host galaxy. The ratios of chromium to zinc equivalent widths
indicate that the host is depleted in dust relative to local
values to a similar degree as damped Ly\ensuremathÎ±
systems at the same redshift.},
