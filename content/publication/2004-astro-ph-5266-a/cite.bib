 abstract = {Dark matter pervades the Solar System, free-streaming at the halo's
local Galactic orbital velocity and density. As these objects
pass through the Solar system, they perturb gravitationally, and
thus very weakly, all nearby inertial masses. Making use of
this, we propose an approach to the direct detection of dark
matter at previously inaccessible intermediate masses (1e14 --
1e20 gm). Such mass scales are relevant for example for dark
matter made of primordial black holes or clumped matter in a
sequestered sector. If such dark matter exists it will be
unambiguously detectable through its inelastic gravitational
interaction with the proposed Laser Interferometer Space Antenna
(LISA) experiment. We demonstrate the efficacy of this approach
by studying the dark matter signal in numerical simulations of
the LISA data stream. A more conservative approach -- to detect
dark matter in the differential acceleration power spectrum --
significantly underestimates the expected rates for LISA.
Interestingly, while the space-density of 1e15 gm DM objects
would be comparable to the space-density of asteroids of similar
masses, such ``light matter'' contaminants are readily
detectable in reflected Solar light, allowing for the
elimination of the major background. <P />},
