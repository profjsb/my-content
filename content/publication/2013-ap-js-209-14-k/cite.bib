 abstract = {The Swift/Burst Alert Telescope (BAT) hard X-ray transient monitor
provides near real-time coverage of the X-ray sky in the energy
range 15-50 keV. The BAT observes 88% of the sky each day with
a detection sensitivity of 5.3 mCrab for a full-day observation
and a time resolution as fine as 64 s. The three main purposes
of the monitor are (1) the discovery of new transient X-ray
sources, (2) the detection of outbursts or other changes in the
flux of known X-ray sources, and (3) the generation of light
curves of more than 900 sources spanning over eight years. The
primary interface for the BAT transient monitor is a public Web
site. Between 2005 February 12 and 2013 April 30, 245 sources
have been detected in the monitor, 146 of them persistent and 99
detected only in outburst. Among these sources, 17 were
previously unknown and were discovered in the transient monitor.
In this paper, we discuss the methodology and the data
processing and filtering for the BAT transient monitor and
review its sensitivity and exposure. We provide a summary of the
source detections and classify them according to the variability
of their light curves. Finally, we review all new BAT monitor
discoveries. For the new sources that are previously
unpublished, we present basic data analysis and interpretations.},
