 abstract = {The Palomar Transient Factory (PTF) is a fully-automated, wide-field
survey aimed at a systematic exploration of the optical
transient sky. The transient survey is performed using a new 8.1
square degree camera installed on the 48 inch Samuel Oschin
telescope at Palomar Observatory; colors and light curves for
detected transients are obtained with the automated Palomar 60
inch telescope. PTF uses 80% of the 1.2 m and 50% of the 1.5 m
telescope time. With an exposure of 60 s the survey reaches a
depth of m$_g$^′$$ \ensuremath≈ 21.3 and m$_R$
\ensuremath≈ 20.6 (5\ensuremathσ, median
seeing). Four major experiments are planned for the five-year
project: (1) a 5 day cadence supernova search; (2) a rapid
transient search with cadences between 90 s and 1 day (3) a
search for eclipsing binaries and transiting planets in Orion;
and (4) a 3\ensuremathπ sr deep H-alpha survey. PTF
provides automatic, real-time transient classification and
follow-up, as well as a database including every source detected
in each frame. This paper summarizes the PTF project, including
several months of on-sky performance tests of the new survey
camera, the observing plans, and the data reduction strategy. We
conclude by detailing the first 51 PTF optical transient
detections, found in commissioning data.},
