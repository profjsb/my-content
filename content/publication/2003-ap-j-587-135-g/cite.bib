 abstract = {We report on Hubble Space Telescope (HST) Wide Field Planetary Camera 2
optical and Space Telescope Imaging Spectrograph (STIS) near-
ultraviolet MAMA observations and ground-based optical
observations of GRB 010222, spanning 15 hr to 71 days. The
observations are well described by a relativistic blast wave
model with a hard electron energy distribution,
p=1.57$^+0.04$$_-0.03$, and a jet transition at
t$_*$=0.93$^+0.15$$_-0.06$ days. These values are slightly
larger than previously found as a result of a correction for the
contribution from the host galaxy to the late-time ground-based
observations and the larger temporal baseline provided by the
HST observations. The host galaxy is found to contain a very
compact core (size &lt;0.25''), which coincides with the
position of the optical transient. The STIS near-ultraviolet
MAMA observations allow for an investigation of the extinction
properties along the line of sight to GRB 010222. We find that
the far-ultraviolet curvature component c$_4$ is rather large.
In combination with the low optical extinction,
A$_V$=0.110$^+0.010$$_-0.021$ mag, when compared with the
hydrogen column inferred from X-ray observations, we suggest
that this is evidence for dust destruction.},
