 abstract = {We present year-long, near-infrared (NIR) Hubble Space Telescope (HST)
WFC3 observations of Mira variables in the water megamaser host
galaxy NGC 4258. Miras are asymptotic giant branch variables
that can be divided into oxygen- (O-) and carbon- (C-) rich
subclasses. Oxygen-rich Miras follow a tight (scatter ̃0.14 mag)
period-luminosity relation (PLR) in the NIR and can be used to
measure extragalactic distances. The water megamaser in NGC 4258
gives a geometric distance to the galaxy accurate to 2.6% that
can serve to calibrate the Mira PLR. We develop criteria for
detecting and classifying O-rich Miras with optical and NIR data
as well as NIR data alone. In total, we discover 438 Mira
candidates that we classify with high confidence as O-rich. Our
most stringent criteria produce a sample of 139 Mira candidates
that we use to measure a PLR. We use the OGLE-III sample of
O-rich Miras in the Large Magellanic Cloud to obtain a relative
distance modulus, \ensuremathμ $_4258$ -
\ensuremathμ $_LMC$ = 10.95 \ensuremath± 0.01
(statistical) \ensuremath±0.06 (systematic) mag, that is
statistically consistent with the relative distance determined
using Cepheids. These results demonstrate the feasibility of
discovering and characterizing Miras using the NIR with the HST
and the upcoming James Webb Space Telescope and using those
Miras to measure extragalactic distances and determine the
Hubble constant.},
