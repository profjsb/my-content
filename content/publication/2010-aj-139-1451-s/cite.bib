 abstract = {We present progenitor-star detections, light curves, and optical spectra
of supernova (SN) 2009ip and the 2009 optical transient in UGC
2773 (U2773-OT), which were not genuine SNe. Precursor
variability in the decade before outburst indicates that both of
the progenitor stars were luminous blue variables (LBVs). Their
pre-outburst light curves resemble the S Doradus phases that
preceded giant eruptions of the prototypical LBVs
\ensuremathη Carinae and SN 1954J (V12 in NGC 2403), with
intermediate progenitor luminosities. Hubble Space Telescope
detections a decade before discovery indicate that the SN 2009ip
and U2773-OT progenitors were supergiants with likely initial
masses of 50-80 M $_sun$ and gsim20 M $_sun$, respectively.
Both outbursts had spectra befitting known LBVs, although in
different physical states. SN 2009ip exhibited a hot LBV
spectrum with characteristic speeds of 550 km s$^-1$, plus
evidence for faster material up to 5000 km s$^-1$, resembling
the slow Homunculus and fast blast wave of \ensuremathη
Carinae. In contrast, U2773-OT shows a forest of narrow
absorption and emission lines comparable to that of S Dor in its
cool state, plus [Ca II] emission and an infrared excess
indicative of dust, similar to SN 2008S and the 2008 optical
transient in NGC 300 (N300-OT). The [Ca II] emission is probably
tied to a dusty pre-outburst environment, and is not a
distinguishing property of the outburst mechanism. The LBV
nature of SN 2009ip and U2773-OT may provide a critical link
between historical LBV eruptions, while U2773-OT may provide a
link between LBVs and the unusual dust-obscured transients SN
2008S and N300-OT. Future searches will uncover more examples of
precursor LBV variability of this kind, providing key clues that
may help unravel the instability driving LBV eruptions in
massive stars.},
