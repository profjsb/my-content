 abstract = {We present extensive early photometric (ultraviolet through near-
infrared) and spectroscopic (optical and near-infrared) data on
supernova (SN) 2008D as well as X-ray data analysis on the
associated Swift X-ray transient (XRT) 080109. Our data span a
time range of 5 hr before the detection of the X-ray transient
to 150 days after its detection, and a detailed analysis allowed
us to derive constraints on the nature of the SN and its
progenitor; throughout we draw comparisons with results
presented in the literature and find several key aspects that
differ. We show that the X-ray spectrum of XRT 080109 can be fit
equally well by an absorbed power law or a superposition of
about equal parts of both power law and blackbody. Our data
first established that SN 2008D is a spectroscopically normal SN
Ib (i.e., showing conspicuous He lines) and showed that SN 2008D
had a relatively long rise time of 18 days and a modest optical
peak luminosity. The early-time light curves of the SN are
dominated by a cooling stellar envelope (for
\ensuremathΔt\ensuremath≈0.1-4 days, most
pronounced in the blue bands) followed by $^56$Ni decay. We
construct a reliable measurement of the bolometric output for
this stripped-envelope SN, and, combined with estimates of E
$_K$ and M $_ej$ from the literature, estimate the stellar
radius R $_sstarf$ of its probable Wolf-Rayet progenitor.
According to the model of Waxman et al. and Chevalier &amp;
Fransson, we derive R $^W07$ $_sstarf$ = 1.2
\ensuremath± 0.7R $_sun$ and R $^CF08$ $_sstarf$ =
12 \ensuremath± 7 R $_sun$, respectively; the latter
being more in line with typical WN stars. Spectra obtained at
three and four months after maximum light show double-peaked
oxygen lines that we associate with departures from spherical
symmetry, as has been suggested for the inner ejecta of a number
of SN Ib cores.},
