 abstract = {We investigate properties of the interstellar medium (ISM) in galaxies
hosting long-duration \ensuremathγ-ray bursts (GRBs)
from an analysis of atomic species (Mg$^0$, Fe$^0$) and
excited fine-structure levels of ions (e.g., Si$^+$). Our
analysis is guided primarily by echelle observations of GRB
050730 and GRB 051111. These sight lines exhibit fine-structure
transitions of O$^0$, Si$^+$, and Fe$^+$ gas that have not
yet been detected in intervening quasar absorption-line systems.
Our results indicate that the gas with large Mg I equivalent
width (e.g., GRB 051111) must occur at distances
&gt;åisebox-0.5ex~50 pc from GRB afterglows
to avoid photoionization. We examine the mechanisms for fine-
structure excitation and find that two processes can contribute:
(1) indirect UV pumping by the GRB afterglow provided a far-UV
intensity in excess of 10$^6$ times the Galactic radiation
field; and (2) collisional excitation in gas with electron
density n$_e$&gt;10$^4$ cm$^-3$. The observed
abundances of excited ions are well explained by UV pumping with
the gas at r\i̊sebox-0.5ex~a few hundred pc
from the afterglow for GRB 051111 and r&lt;100 pc for GRB
050730, without invoking extreme gas density and temperature in
the ISM. We show that UV pumping alone provides a simple
explanation for all reported detections of excited ions in GRB
afterglow spectra. The presence of strong fine-structure
transitions therefore may offer little constraint for the gas
density or temperature. We discuss additional implications of UV
pumping including its impact on chemical abundance measurements,
new prospects for observing line-strength variability, and
future prospects for studying the gas density and temperature.
Finally, we list a series of criteria that can distinguish
between the mechanisms of UV pumping and collisional excitation.},
