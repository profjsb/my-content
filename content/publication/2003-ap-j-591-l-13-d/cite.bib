 abstract = {We present the optical and near-IR identification and spectroscopy of
the host galaxy of gamma-ray burst GRB 980613. The burst was
apparently associated with the optically (rest-frame UV)
brightest component of an apparent system of at least five
galaxies or galaxy fragments, at least two of which are at a
redshift of z=1.0969. The component we identify as the host
galaxy shows a moderately high unobscured star formation rate,
SFRÃ¥isebox-0.5ex~5 M$_solar $ yr$^-1$, but
a high SFR per unit mass, indicative of a starburst. The image
components show a broad range of (R-K) colors, with two of them
being very red, possibly due to dust. The overall morphology of
the system can be naturally interpreted as a strong tidal
interaction of two or more galaxies, at a redshift where such
events were much more common than now. Given the well-
established causal link between galaxy mergers and starbursts,
we propose that this is a strong case for a GRB originating from
a merger-induced starburst system. This supports the proposed
link between GRBs and massive star formation. <P />Partially

Research in Astronomy, a scientific partnership among the
