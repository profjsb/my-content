 abstract = {Gas accretion onto some massive black holes (MBHs) at the centers of
galaxies actively powers luminous emission, but most MBHs are
considered dormant. Occasionally, a star passing too near an MBH
is torn apart by gravitational forces, leading to a bright tidal
disruption flare (TDF). Although the high-energy transient Sw
1644+57 initially displayed none of the theoretically
anticipated (nor previously observed) TDF characteristics, we
show that observations suggest a sudden accretion event onto a
central MBH of mass about 10$^6$ to 10$^7$ solar masses.
There is evidence for a mildly relativistic outflow, jet
collimation, and a spectrum characterized by synchrotron and
inverse Compton processes; this leads to a natural analogy of Sw
1644+57 to a temporary smaller-scale blazar.},
