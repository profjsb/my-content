 abstract = {The Palomar Transient Factory (PTF) is a wide-field experiment designed
to investigate the optical transient and variable sky on time
scales from minutes to years. PTF uses the CFH12k mosaic camera,
with a field of view of 7.9 deg$^2$ and a plate scale of 1â€³
pixel$^-1$, mounted on the Palomar Observatory 48 inch Samuel
Oschin Telescope. The PTF operation strategy is devised to probe
the existing gaps in the transient phase space and to search for
theoretically predicted, but not yet detected, phenomena, such
as fallback supernovae, macronovae,. Ia supernovae, and the
orphan afterglows of gamma-ray bursts. PTF will also discover
many new members of known source classes, from cataclysmic
variables in their various avatars to supernovae and active
galactic nuclei, and will provide important insights into
understanding galactic dynamics (through RR Lyrae stars) and the
solar system (asteroids and near-Earth objects). The lessons
that can be learned from PTF will be essential for the
preparation of future large synoptic sky surveys like the Large
Synoptic Survey Telescope. In this article we present the
scientific motivation for PTF and describe in detail the goals
and expectations for this experiment.},
