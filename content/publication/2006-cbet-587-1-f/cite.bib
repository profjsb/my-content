 abstract = {R. J. Foley, J. S. Bloom, D. A. Perley, and N. R. Butler, University of
California, Berkeley, report that inspection of CCD spectra
(range 330-920 nm), obtained on July 25 UT with the Keck I 10-m
telescope (+ LRIS) show that SNe 2006di (IAUC 8726) and 2006dv
(IAUC 8733) are both of type Ia. The spectrum of 2006di is
consistent with a type-Ia supernova approximately 40 days after
maximum light. SN 2006dv has a spectral-feature age (Riess et
al. 1997, A.J. 114, 722) of 1.5 +/- 2.0 days relative to maximum
light; adopting a recession velocity of 9940 km/s, found from
weak Na D absorption, the minimum of the Si II 635.5-nm
absorption is found to be blueshifted by 11200 km/s.},
