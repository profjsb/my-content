 abstract = {We report the detection of eclipses in GJ 3236, a bright (I = 11.6),
very low mass binary system with an orbital period of 0.77 days.
Analysis of light and radial velocity curves of the system
yielded component masses of 0.38 \ensuremath± 0.02 M
$_sun$ and 0.28 \ensuremath± 0.02 M $_sun$. The
central values for the stellar radii are larger than the
theoretical models predict for these masses, in agreement with
the results for existing eclipsing binaries, although the
present 5% observational uncertainties limit the significance
of the larger radii to approximately 1\ensuremathσ.
Degeneracies in the light curve models resulting from the
unknown configuration of surface spots on the components of GJ
3236 currently dominate the uncertainties in the radii, and
could be reduced by obtaining precise, multiband photometry
covering the full orbital period. The system appears to be
tidally synchronized and shows signs of high activity levels as
expected for such a short orbital period, evidenced by strong
H\ensuremathα emission lines in the spectra of both
components. These observations probe an important region of
mass-radius parameter space around the predicted transition to
fully convective stellar interiors, where there are a limited
number of precise measurements available in the literature.},
