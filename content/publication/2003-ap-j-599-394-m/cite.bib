 abstract = {We present extensive optical and infrared photometry of the afterglow of
gamma-ray burst (GRB) 030329 and its associated supernova (SN)
2003dh over the first two months after detection (2003 March
30-May 29 UT). Optical spectroscopy from a variety of telescopes
is shown and, when combined with the photometry, allows an
unambiguous separation between the afterglow and SN
contributions. The optical afterglow of the GRB is initially a
power-law continuum but shows significant color variations
during the first week that are unrelated to the presence of an
SN. The early afterglow light curve also shows deviations from
the typical power-law decay. An SN spectrum is first detectable
åisebox-0.5ex~7 days after the burst and
dominates the light after \i̊sebox-0.5ex~11
days. The spectral evolution and the light curve are shown to
closely resemble those of SN 1998bw, a peculiar Type Ic SN
associated with GRB 980425, and the time of the SN explosion is
close to the observed time of the GRB. It is now clear that at
least some GRBs arise from core-collapse SNe.},
