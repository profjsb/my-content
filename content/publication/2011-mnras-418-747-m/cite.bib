 abstract = {PTF10ops is a Type Ia supernova (SN Ia), whose light curve and spectral
properties place it outside the current SN Ia subtype
classifications. Its spectra display the characteristic lines of
subluminous SNe Ia, but it has a normal-width light curve with a
long rise time, typical of normal-luminosity SNe Ia. The early-
time optical spectra of PTF10ops were modelled using a spectral
fitting code and found to have all the lines typically seen in
subluminous SNe Ia, without the need to invoke more uncommon
elements. The host galaxy environment of PTF10ops is also
unusual with no galaxy detected at the position of the SN down
to an absolute limiting magnitude of r\ensuremath≥-12.0
mag, but a very massive galaxy is present at a separation of
̃148 kpc and at the same redshift as suggested by the SN
spectral features. The progenitor of PTF10ops is most likely a
very old star, possibly in a low-metallicity environment, which
affects its explosion mechanism and observational
characteristics. PTF10ops does not easily fit into any of the
current models of either subluminous or normal SN Ia progenitor
channels.},
