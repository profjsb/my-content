 abstract = {We present our extensive observational campaign on the Swift-discovered
GRB 141121A, almost 10 years after its launch. Our observations
cover radio through X-rays and extend for more than 30 days
after discovery. The prompt phase of GRB 141121A lasted 1410 s
and, at the derived redshift of z = 1.469, the isotropic energy
is E$_\ensuremathγ,iso$ = 8.0 ×
10$^52$ erg. Due to the long prompt duration, GRB 141121A
falls into the recently discovered class of ultra-long GRBs (UL-
GRBs). Peculiar features of this burst are (1) a flat early-time
optical light curve and (2) a radio-to-X-ray rebrightening
around three days after the burst. The latter is followed by a
steep optical-to-X-ray decay and a much shallower radio fading.
We analyze GRB 141121A in the context of the standard forward-
reverse shock (FS, RS) scenario and we disentangle the FS and RS
contributions. Finally, we comment on the puzzling early-time (t
\ensuremathłesssim 3 days) behavior of GRB 141121A, and
suggest that its interpretation may require a two-component jet
model. Overall, our analysis confirms that the class of UL-GRBs
represents our best opportunity to firmly establish the
prominent emission mechanisms in action during powerful gamma-
ray burst explosions, and future missions (like SVOM, XTiDE, or
ISS-Lobster) will provide many more of such objects.},
