 abstract = {We take advantage of the first data from the Sydney-AAO Multi-object
Integral field Galaxy Survey to investigate the relation between
the kinematics of gas and stars, and stellar mass in a
comprehensive sample of nearby galaxies. We find that all 235
objects in our sample, regardless of their morphology, lie on a
tight relation linking stellar mass (M $_*$) to internal
velocity quantified by the S $_0.5$ parameter, which combines
the contribution of both dispersion (\ensuremathσ) and
rotational velocity (V $_rot$) to the dynamical support of a
galaxy (S$_0.5$=\sqrt\0.5
V_rot$^2$+\ensuremathσ $^2$\). Our results are
independent of the baryonic component from which
\ensuremathσ and V $_rot$ are estimated, as the S
$_0.5$ of stars and gas agree remarkably well. This represents
a significant improvement compared to the canonical M $_*$
versus V $_rot$ and M $_*$ versus \ensuremathσ
relations. Not only is no sample pruning necessary, but also
stellar and gas kinematics can be used simultaneously, as the
effect of asymmetric drift is taken into account once V $_rot$
and \ensuremathσ are combined. Our findings illustrate
how the combination of dispersion and rotational velocities for
both gas and stars can provide us with a single dynamical
scaling relation valid for galaxies of all morphologies across
at least the stellar mass range 8.5 &lt;log (M $_*$/M $_☉$)
&lt; 11. Such relation appears to be more general and at least
as tight as any other dynamical scaling relation, representing a
unique tool for investigating the link between galaxy kinematics
and baryonic content, and a less biased comparison with
theoretical models.},
