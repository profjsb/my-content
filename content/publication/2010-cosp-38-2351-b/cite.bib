 abstract = {The EXIST mission will transform the way that gamma-ray bursts (GRBs)
are studied and the ways in which the universe will be probed.
Here, we review the EXIST ``GRBs a probes'' science objectives
in light of recent discoveries. EXIST will not only discover
dozens of z Â¿ 7 GRBs but obtain the necessary
followup onboard -with the X-ray imager and optical-IR imaging
spectrograph -to probe the nature of metal enrichment in nascent
galaxies and the reionization history of the universe. <P />},
