 abstract = {The gamma-ray burst of 1997 February 28 (GRB 970228) ushered in the
discovery of the afterglow phenomenon. Despite intense study of
the nearby galaxy, however, the nature of this galaxy and the
distance to the burst eluded the community. Here we present the
measurement of the redshift of the galaxy, the putative host
galaxy of GRB 970228, and, based on its spectroscopic and
photometric properties, identify the galaxy as a subluminous but
otherwise normal galaxy at redshift z=0.695 undergoing a modest
level of star formation. At this redshift, the GRB released an
isotropic-equivalent energy of
(1.4+/-0.3)Ã—10$^52$ ergs (20-2000 keV rest
frame). We find no evidence that the host is significantly bluer
or is forming stars more vigorously than the general field
population. In fact, by all accounts in our analysis (color-
magnitude, magnitude-radius, star formation rate, and Balmer-
break amplitude), the host properties appear typical for faint
blue field galaxies at comparable redshifts. Partially based on
the observations obtained at the W. M. Keck Observatory, which
is operated by the California Association for Research in
Astronomy, a scientific partnership among California Institute
of Technology, the University of California, and the National
Aeronautics and Space Administration.},
