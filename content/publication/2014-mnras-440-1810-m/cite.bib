 abstract = {We present broad-band observations and analysis of Swift gamma-ray burst
(GRB) 120119A. Our early-time afterglow detections began under
15 s after the burst in the host frame (redshift z = 1.73), and
they yield constraints on the burst energetics and local
environment. Late-time afterglow observations of the burst show
evidence for a moderate column of dust (A$_V$
\ensuremath≈ 1.1 mag) similar to, but statistically
distinct from, dust seen along Small Magellanic Cloud
sightlines. Deep late-time observations reveal a dusty, rapidly
star-forming host galaxy. Most notably, our early-time
observations exhibit a significant red-to-blue colour change in
the first ̃200 s after the trigger at levels heretofore unseen
in GRB afterglows. This colour change, which is coincident with
the final phases of the prompt emission, is a hallmark
prediction of the photodestruction of dust in GRB afterglows. We
test whether dust-destruction signatures are significantly
distinct from other sources of colour change, namely a change in
the intrinsic spectral index \ensuremathβ. We find that
a time-varying power-law spectrum alone cannot adequately
describe the observed colour change, and allowing for dust
destruction (via a time-varying A$_V$) significantly improves
the fit. While not definitively ruling out other possibilities,
this event provides the best support yet for the direct
detection of dust destruction in the local environment of a GRB.},
