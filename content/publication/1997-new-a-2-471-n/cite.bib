 abstract = {If the optical transient to gamma-ray burst (GRB) 970508 is indeed
associated with the 8 May burst and is connected with the z =
0.835 absorption system reported by Metzger et al. (1997)
[Natur, 387, 879], then either the GRB originated from an
intrinsically very faint galaxy (L \ensuremathłesssim
0.01L$_\ensuremath*$) or it occurred at a large distance
from a host galaxy (\ensuremath\gtrsim25
h$_70$$^-1$kpc); a large offset of GRBs from galaxies would
tend to favour the merging neutron star-neutron star (NS-NS)
model (Mészáros &amp; Rees, 1993 [ApJ, 405, 278];
Narayan et al., 1997 [ApJL, 395, 83]). Here we show that the
properties of a suspected host galaxy, particularly its
intrinsic brightness and comoving distance from the transient,
can be constrained indirectly using the Mg II absorption
features detected in the spectrum of the optical transient
(Metzger et al., 1997 [IAUC, 6676]) by examining the galaxies in
the vicinity of the optical transient from ground-based and
Hubble Space Telescope (HST) images. This is an independent test
of the brightness of GRB host galaxies irrespective of distances
implied from logN-logP distributions. The spectral lines most
likely arise from absorption by very underluminous galaxies; in
which case the optical transient has revealed the presence of a
population of intermediate-redshift dwarf galaxies.},
