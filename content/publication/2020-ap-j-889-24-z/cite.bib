 abstract = {Cosmic ray (CR) identification and replacement are critical components
of imaging and spectroscopic reduction pipelines involving
solid-state detectors. We present deepCR, a deep-learning-based
framework for CR identification and subsequent image inpainting
based on the predicted CR mask. To demonstrate the effectiveness
of this framework, we train and evaluate models on Hubble Space
Telescope (HST) ACS/WFC images of sparse extragalactic fields,
globular clusters, and resolved galaxies. We demonstrate that at
a false-positive rate of 0.5%, deepCR achieves close to 100%
detection rates in both extragalactic and globular cluster
fields, and 91% in resolved galaxy fields, which is a
significant improvement over the current state-of-the-art method
LACosmic. Compared with a multicore CPU implementation of
LACosmic, deepCR CR mask predictions run up to 6.5 times faster
on a CPU and 90 times faster on a single GPU. For image
inpainting, the mean squared errors of deepCR predictions are 20
times lower in globular cluster fields, 5 times lower in
resolved galaxy fields, and 2.5 times lower in extragalactic
fields, compared with the best performing nonneural technique
tested. We present our framework and the trained models as an
open-source Python project , with a simple-to-use API. To
facilitate reproducibility of the results we also provide a
benchmarking codebase .},
