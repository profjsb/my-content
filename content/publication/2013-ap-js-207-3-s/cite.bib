 abstract = {Owing to their utility for measurements of cosmic acceleration, Type Ia
supernovae (SNe Ia) are perhaps the best-studied class of SNe,
yet the progenitor systems of these explosions largely remain a
mystery. A rare subclass of SNe Ia shows evidence of strong
interaction with their circumstellar medium (CSM), and in
particular, a hydrogen-rich CSM; we refer to them as SNe Ia-CSM.
In the first systematic search for such systems, we have
identified 16 SNe Ia-CSM, and here we present new spectra of 13
of them. Six SNe Ia-CSM have been well studied previously, three
were previously known but are analyzed in depth for the first
time here, and seven are new discoveries from the Palomar
Transient Factory. The spectra of all SNe Ia-CSM are dominated
by H\ensuremathα emission (with widths of
åisebox-0.5ex~2000 km s$^-1$) and exhibit
large H\ensuremathα/H\ensuremathβ intensity
ratios (perhaps due to collisional excitation of hydrogen via
the SN ejecta overtaking slower-moving CSM shells); moreover,
they have an almost complete lack of He I emission. They also
show possible evidence of dust formation through a decrease in
the red wing of H\ensuremathα 75-100 days past maximum
brightness, and nearly all SNe Ia-CSM exhibit strong Na I D
absorption from the host galaxy. The absolute magnitudes
(uncorrected for host-galaxy extinction) of SNe Ia-CSM are found
to be -21.3 mag &lt;= M$_R$ &lt;= -19 mag, and they also
seem to show ultraviolet emission at early times and strong
infrared emission at late times (but no detected radio or X-ray
emission). Finally, the host galaxies of SNe Ia-CSM are all
late-type spirals similar to the Milky Way, or dwarf irregulars
like the Large Magellanic Cloud, which implies that these
objects come from a relatively young stellar population. This
work represents the most detailed analysis of the SN Ia-CSM
class to date.},
