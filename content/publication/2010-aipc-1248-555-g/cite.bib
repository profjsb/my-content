 abstract = {The epochs of origin of the first stars and galaxies, and subsequent
growth of the first supermassive black holes, are among the most
fundamental questions. Observations of the highest redshift
Gamma-Ray Bursts (GRBs) will be the most compelling in situ
probe of the history of initial star formation and consequent
epoch of reionization if their prompt and precise detection can
be followed immediately by sensitive near-IR imaging and
spectroscopy. Blazars are the persistent analogs of GRBs and for
the same reason (beaming) can be observed at highest redshifts
where they might best trace the high accretion rate-driven jets
and growth of supermassive black holes in galaxies. The proposed
EXIST mission can uniquely probe these questions, and many
others, given its unparalled combination of sensitivity and
spatial-spectral-temporal coverage and resolution. Here we
provide a brief summary of the mission design, key science
objectives, mission plan and readiness for EXIST, as proposed to
Astro2010. <P />},
