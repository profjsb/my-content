 abstract = {We report the discovery of the optical and radio afterglow of GRB
010921, the first gamma-ray burst afterglow to be found from a
localization by the High Energy Transient Explorer satellite. We
present optical spectroscopy of the host galaxy, which we find
to be a dusty and apparently normal star-forming galaxy at
z=0.451. The unusually steep optical spectral slope of the
afterglow can be explained by heavy extinction, A$_V$&gt;0.5
mag, along the line of sight to the GRB. Dust with similar
A$_V$ for the host galaxy as a whole appears to be required by
the measurement of a Balmer decrement in the spectrum of the
host galaxy.},
