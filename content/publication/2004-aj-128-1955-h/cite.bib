 abstract = {We present BVR$_C$JHK$_s$ photometry of the optical afterglow of the
gamma-ray burst GRB 021211 taken at the Magellan, MMT, and WIYN
observatories between 0.7 and 50 days after the burst. We find
an intrinsic spectral slope at optical and near-infrared
wavelengths of 0.69+/-0.14 at 0.87 days. The optical decay
during the first day is almost identical to that of GRB 990123
except that GRB 021211's optical afterglow was intrinsically
approximately 38 times fainter and the transition from the
reverse shock to the forward shock may have occurred earlier
than it did for GRB 990123. We find no evidence for a jet break
or the cooling break passing through optical frequencies during
the first day after the burst. There is weak evidence for a
break in the J-band decay between 0.89 and 1.87 days, which may
be due to a jet. The optical and infrared data are consistent
with a relativistic fireball where the shocked electrons are in
the slow cooling regime and the electron index is 2.3+/-0.1. The
forward shock appears to have been expanding in a homogeneous
ambient medium during the first day after the burst. Our
analysis suggests that the jet of GRB 021211 may have a small
opening angle and that the total gamma-ray energy is likely to
be much less than the canonical value of
1.33Ã—10$^51$ ergs. If this is the case, then it
is possible that most of the energy of the burst is in another
form such as a frozen magnetic field, supernova ejecta, or a
second jet component. The host galaxy of GRB 021211 is
subluminous and has a star formation rate of at least 1
M$_solar$ yr$^-1$. <P />Some of the observations reported
here were obtained at the MMT Observatory, a joint facility of
the Smithsonian Institution and the University of Arizona. Some
of the observations reported here were obtained with the
Magellan 2 (Landon Clay) telescope at the Las Campanas
Observatory. Some of the observations reported here were taken
at the WIYN Observatory, a joint facility of the University of
Wisconsin-Madison, Indiana University, Yale University, and the
National Optical Astronomy Observatory.},
