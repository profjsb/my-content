 abstract = {We report the serendipitous detection of a very bright, very nearby
microlensing event. In late 2006 October, an otherwise
unremarkable A0 star at a distance of
åisebox-0.5ex~1 kpc (GSC 3656-1328) brightened
achromatically by a factor of nearly 40 over the span of several
days and then decayed in an apparently symmetrical way. We
present a light curve of the event based on optical photometry
from the Center for Backyard Astrophysics and the All Sky
Automated Survey, as well as near-infrared photometry from the
Peters Automated Infrared Imaging Telescope. This light curve is
well fit by a generic microlensing model. We also report optical
spectra and Swift X-ray and UV observations that are consistent
with the microlensing interpretation. We discuss and reject
alternative explanations for this variability. The lens star is
probably a low-mass star or brown dwarf, with a relatively high
proper motion of gtrsim20 mas yr$^-1$, and may be visible
using precise optical/infrared imaging taken several years from
now. A modest, all-sky survey telescope could detect
\i̊sebox-0.5ex~10 such events per year, which
would enable searches for very low mass planetary companions to
relatively nearby stars.},
