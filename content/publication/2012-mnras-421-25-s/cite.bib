 abstract = {We present comprehensive X-ray, optical, near- and mid-infrared and
submm observations of GRB 080207 and its host galaxy. The
afterglow was undetected in the optical and near-infrared (nIR)
implying an X-ray-to-optical spectral slope less than 0.3,
identifying GRB 080207 as a dark burst. Swift X-ray observations
show extreme absorption in the host, which is confirmed by the
unusually large optical extinction found by modelling the X-ray
to nIR afterglow spectral energy distribution. Our Chandra
observations obtained 8 d post-burst allow us to place the
afterglow on the sky to subarcsec accuracy, enabling us to
pinpoint an extremely red galaxy (ERO), with R-K &gt; 5.4 (g-K̃
7.5, VEGAmag) at the afterglow location. Follow-up host
observations with the Hubble Space Telescope, Spitzer Space
Telescope, Gemini, Keck and the James Clerk Maxwell Telescope
provide a photometric redshift solution of ?
(1\ensuremathσ, 1.56 &lt; z &lt; 2.08 at
2\ensuremathσ) for the ERO host, and suggest that it is
a massive and morphologically disturbed ultraluminous infrared
galaxy system, with L$_FIR$̃ 2.4 × 10$^12$
L$_☉$. These results add to the growing evidence that gamma-
ray bursts (GRBs) originating in very red hosts always show some
evidence of dust extinction in their afterglows (though the
converse is not true - some extinguished afterglows are found in
blue hosts). This indicates that a poorly constrained fraction
of GRBs occurs in very dusty environments. By comparing the
inferred stellar masses, and estimates of the gas phase
metallicity in both GRB hosts and submm galaxies we suggest that
many GRB hosts, even at z &gt; 2, are at lower metallicity than
the submm galaxy population, offering a likely explanation for
the dearth of submm-detected GRB hosts. However, we also show
that the dark GRB hosts are systematically more massive than
those hosting optically bright events, perhaps implying that
previous host samples are severely biased by the exclusion of
dark events.},
