 abstract = {We present photometry of the transient associated with
\ensuremathγ-burst (GRB) 030329 obtained with the Cerro
Tololo Inter-American Observatory 1.3 meter telescope and the
ANDICAM instrument, a dual optical/infrared imager. Without the
need for light-curve interpolation to produce snapshot broadband
spectra, we show that the transient spectrum remained
statistically achromatic from day 2.7 to day 5.6, during a
rebrightening episode. Associating the light in these early
epochs with the GRB afterglow, we infer a modest level of
extinction due to the host galaxy in the line of sight toward
the GRB: A$_V$(host)=0.30+/-0.03 mag for
\ensuremathβ=-0.5 and A$_V$(host)&lt;0.4 mag (3
\ensuremathσ) for any physically plausible value of
\ensuremathβ (with flux f$_\ensuremathν$åisebo
x-0.5ex~\ensuremathłambda$^-\ensuremath\
beta$). We conclude that the spectral slope of the afterglow
component was more than \ensuremathβ=-0.8 between day
2.7 and 5.6 after the GRB, excluding the possibility that the
synchrotron cooling break passed through the optical/IR bandpass
over that period. Taking extinction into account, a
decomposition of the light curve into an afterglow and supernova
component requires the presence of a supernova (SN) similar to
that of SN 1998bw, an afterglow that shows some evidence for a
second break around day 8-10 and a fifth rebrightening event
around day 15. Assuming a, SN 1988bw-like evolution and a
contemporaneous GRB and SN event, the peak SN brightness was
M$_V$=(-19.8+/-0.4)-5logh$_65$ mag.},
