 abstract = {Some observations suggest that very massive stars experience extreme
mass-loss episodes shortly before they explode as supernovae, as
do several models. Establishing a causal connection between
these mass-loss episodes and the final explosion would provide a
novel way to study pre-supernova massive-star evolution. Here we
report observations of a mass-loss event detected 40 days before
the explosion of the type IIn supernova SN 2010mc (also known as
PTF 10tel). Our photometric and spectroscopic data suggest that
this event is a result of an energetic outburst, radiating at
least 6 × 10$^47$ erg of energy and releasing
about 10$^-2$ solar masses of material at typical velocities
of 2,000 km s$^-1$. The temporal proximity of the mass-loss
outburst and the supernova explosion implies a causal connection
between them. Moreover, we find that the outburst luminosity and
velocity are consistent with the predictions of the wave-driven
pulsation model, and disfavour alternative suggestions.},
