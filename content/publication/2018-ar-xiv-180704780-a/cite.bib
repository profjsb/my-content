 abstract = {The past year has witnessed discovery of the first identified
counterparts to a gravitational wave transient (GW 170817A) and
a very high-energy neutrino (IceCube-170922A). These source
identifications, and ensuing detailed studies, have realized
longstanding dreams of astronomers and physicists to routinely
carry out observations of cosmic sources by other than
electromagnetic means, and inaugurated the era of ``multi-
messenger'' astronomy. While this new era promises extraordinary
physical insights into the universe, it brings with it new
challenges, including: highly heterogeneous, high-volume, high-
velocity datasets; globe-spanning cross-disciplinary teams of
researchers, regularly brought together into transient
collaborations; an extraordinary breadth and depth of domain-
specific knowledge and computing resources required to
anticipate, model, and interpret observations; and the routine
need for adaptive, distributed, rapid-response observing
campaigns to fully exploit the scientific potential of each
source. We argue, therefore, that the time is ripe for the
community to conceive and propose an Institute for Multi-
Messenger Astrophysics that would coordinate its resources in a
sustained and strategic fashion to efficiently address these
challenges, while simultaneously serving as a center for
education and key supporting activities. In this fashion, we can
prepare now to realize the bright future that we see, beyond,
through these newly opened windows onto the universe. <P />},
