 abstract = {Even with the renaissance in gamma-ray burst (GRB) research fostered by
the Swift satellite, few bursts have both contemporaneous
observations at long wavelengths and exquisite observations at
later times across the electromagnetic spectrum. We present here
contemporaneous imaging with the KAIT robotic optical telescope,
dense optical sampling with Lulin, supplemented with infrared
data from PAIRITEL and radio to gamma-ray data from the
literature. For the first time, we can test the constancy of
microphysical parameters in the internal-external shock paradigm
and carefully trace the flow of energy from the GRB to the
surrounding medium. KAIT data taken
&lt;åisebox-0.5ex~1 minute after the start of
GRB 051111 and coinciding with the fading gamma-ray tail of the
prompt emission indicate a smooth reinjection of energy into the
shock. No color change is apparent in observations beginning
\i̊sebox-0.5ex~1.5 minutes after the GRB and
lasting for the first hour after the burst. There are achromatic
flux modulations about the best-fit model at late
(t\rs̊ebox-0.5ex~10$^4$ s) times, possibly
due to variations in the external density. We find that the host
galaxy extinction is well fit by a curve similar to that of the
Small Magellanic Cloud. Low visual extinction,
A$_V$\rae̊box-0.5ex~0.2 mag, combined with
high column densities determined from the X-ray and optical
spectroscopy (N$_H$&gt;10$^21$ cm$^-2$), indicate a low
dust-to-metals ratio and a possible overabundance of the light
metals. An apparent small ratio of total to selective extinction
(R$_V$\raib̊ox-0.5ex~2) argues against dust
destruction by the GRB. Time constancy of both the IR/optical/UV
spectral energy distribution and the soft X-ray absorption
suggests that the absorbing material is not local to the GRB.},
