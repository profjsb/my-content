 abstract = {Long-duration gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) are widely believed to be highly
collimated explosions (bipolar conical outflows with half-
opening angle \ensuremathþeta\ensuremath≈
1°-10°). As a result of this beaming
factor, the true energy release from a GRB is usually several
orders of magnitude smaller than the observed isotropic value.
Measuring this opening angle, typically inferred from an
achromatic steepening in the afterglow light curve (a ``jet''
break), has proven exceedingly difficult in the Swift era. Here,
we undertake a study of five of the brightest (in terms of the
isotropic prompt \ensuremathγ-ray energy release, E
$_\ensuremathγ,iso$) GRBs in the Swift era to search
for jet breaks and hence constrain the collimation-corrected
energy release. We present multi-wavelength (radio through
X-ray) observations of GRBs 050820A, 060418, and 080319B, and
construct afterglow models to extract the opening angle and
beaming-corrected energy release for all three events. Together
with results from previous analyses of GRBs 050904 and 070125,
we find evidence for an achromatic jet break in all five events,
strongly supporting the canonical picture of GRBs as collimated
explosions. The most natural explanation for the lack of
observed jet breaks from most Swift GRBs is therefore selection
effects. However, the opening angles for the events in our
sample are larger than would be expected if all GRBs had a
canonical energy release of
åisebox-0.5ex~10$^51$ erg. The total
energy release we measure for the ``hyper-energetic'' (E
$_tot$ &gt;\i̊sebox-0.5ex~ 10$^52$ erg)
events in our sample is large enough to start challenging models
with a magnetar as the compact central remnant.},
