 abstract = {The discovery of the electromagnetic counterpart to the binary neutron
star merger GW170817 has opened the era of gravitational-wave
multi-messenger astronomy. Rapid identification of the
optical/infrared kilonova enabled a precise localization of the
source, which paved the way to deep multi-wavelength follow-up
and its myriad of related science results. Fully exploiting this
new territory of exploration requires the acquisition of
electromagnetic data from samples of neutron star mergers and
other gravitational wave sources. After GW170817, the frontier
is now to map the diversity of kilonova properties and provide
more stringent constraints on the Hubble constant, and enable
new tests of fundamental physics. The Vera C. Rubin
Observatory's Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) can play a
key role in this field in the 2020s, when an improved network of
gravitational-wave detectors is expected to reach a sensitivity
that will enable the discovery of a high rate of merger events
involving neutron stars (about tens per year) out to distances
of several hundred Mpc. We design comprehensive target-of-
opportunity observing strategies for follow-up of gravitational-
wave triggers that will make the Rubin Observatory the premier
instrument for discovery and early characterization of neutron
star and other compact object mergers, and yet unknown classes
of gravitational wave events.},
