 abstract = {The isotropic distribution of gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) as observed with
the Burst and Transient Source Experiment (BATSE) strongly
suggests that the bursts are at cosmological distances. At such
distances, the expansion of the universe should redshift the
spectra and stretch the temporal structure. Indeed, such time
dilation has been observed through a variety of analyses and
over all observed timescales in gamma-ray bursts. We relate the
observed peak intensities, spectral shapes, and time dilation to
absolute distance. We include the uncertainties in our knowledge
of the intrinsic spectrum and correct for the coupling between
the spectral shape and the temporal structure. Assuming a
q$_0$ = ½ cosmology, the reported time dilation
between the dimmest BATSE bursts and the bright BATSE bursts (a
factor of ̃2) requires a standard candle luminosity of
̃10$^52$ ergs$^-1$, which translates into a redshift of
&gt;6 for the dimmest BATSE bursts rather than a redshift of 1
or 2, as previously reported. An alternative method to determine
the distance to cosmological GRBs is to use the log N-log P
distribution. The large luminosity and distance determined from
the time dilation is inconsistent with the observed log N-log P
distribution (which requires a luminosity of 4.6 ×
10$^50$ ergs s$^-1$ and z ̃0.8) unless there is very
strong evolution. Cosmologies with q$_0$ \ensuremath\neq
½ give similar results. The implied distance for
the dimmest bursts is beyond where galaxies are thought to form.
If true, the gamma-ray bursts would be orphans: no known objects
would have the same distance scale. We conclude that either a
large fraction (65%) of the observed time dilation between the
BATSE bright and dimmest bursts is intrinsic to the bursts or
that there are strong evolutionary effects in the log N-log P
distribution and that it is only a coincidence that log N-log P
shows a -3/2 power law at high intensities. <P />},
