 abstract = {The Palomar Transient Factory (PTF) is a new fully-automated, wide-field
survey conducting a systematic exploration of the optical
transient sky. The transient survey is performed using a new 8.1
square degree, 101 megapixel camera installed on the 48-inch
Samuel Oschin Telescope at Palomar Observatory. The PTF Camera
achieved first light at the end of 2008, completed commissioning
in July 2009, and is now in routine science operations. The
camera is based on the CFH12K camera, and was extensively
modified for use on the 48-inch telescope. A field-flattening
curved window was installed, the cooling system was re-
engineered and upgraded to closed-cycle, custom shutter and
filter exchanger mechanisms were added, new custom control
software was written, and many other modifications were made. We
here describe the performance of these new systems during the
first year of Palomar Transient Factory operations, including a
detailed and long term on-sky performance characterization. We
also describe lessons learned during the construction and
commissioning of the upgraded camera, the photometric and
astrometric precision currently achieved with the PTF camera,
and briefly summarize the first supernova results from the PTF
survey. <P />},
