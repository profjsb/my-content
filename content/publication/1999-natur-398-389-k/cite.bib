 abstract = {Long-lived emission, known as afterglow, has now been detected from
about a dozen \ensuremathγ-ray bursts. Distance
determinations place the bursts at cosmological distances, with
redshifts, z, ranging from åisebox-0.5ex~1 to
3. The energy required to produce these bright
\ensuremathγ-ray flashes is enormous: up to
\i̊sebox-0.5ex~10$^ 53$erg, or 10 per cent of
the rest-mass energy of a neutron star, if the emission is
isotropic. Here we present optical and near-infrared
observations of the afterglow of GRB990123, and we determine a
redshift of z &gt;= 1.6. This is to date the brightest
\ensuremathγ-ray burst with a well-localized position
and if the \ensuremathγ-rays were emitted
isotropically, the energy release exceeds the rest-mass energy
of a neutron star, so challenging current theoretical models of
the sources. We argue, however, that our data may provide
evidence of beamed (rather than isotropic) radiation, thereby
reducing the total energy released to a level where stellar-
death models are still tenable.},
