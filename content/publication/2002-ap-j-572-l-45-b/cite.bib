 abstract = {Using observations from an extensive monitoring campaign with the Hubble
Space Telescope, we present the detection of an intermediate-
time flux excess that is redder in color relative to the
afterglow of GRB 011121, currently distinguished as the gamma-
ray burst with the lowest known redshift. The red ``bump,''
which exhibits a spectral rollover at
åisebox-0.5ex~7200 \Å, is well described
by a redshifted Type Ic supernova that occurred approximately at
the same time as the gamma-ray burst event. The inferred
luminosity is about half that of the bright supernova SN 1998bw.
These results serve as compelling evidence for a massive star
origin of long-duration gamma-ray bursts. Models that posit a
supernova explosion weeks to months preceding the gamma-ray
burst event are excluded by these observations. Finally, we
discuss the relationship between spherical core-collapse
supernovae and gamma-ray bursts. Based on observations with the
NASA/ESA Hubble Space Telescope, obtained at the Space Telescope
Science Institute, which is operated by the Association of
Universities for Research in Astronomy, Inc., under NASA
contract NAS5-26555.},
