 abstract = {Context. In August 2008, the accreting milli-second X-ray pulsar (AMXP),
IGR J00291+5934, underwent an outburst lasting
åisebox-0.5ex~100 days, the first since its
discovery in 2004. <BR /> Aims: We present data from the 2008
double-peaked outburst of IGR J00291+5934 from Faulkes Telescope
North, the Isaac Newton Telescope, the Keck Telescope, PAIRITEL,
the Westerbork Synthesis Radio Telescope and the Swift, XMM-
Newton and RXTE X-ray missions. We study the outburst's
evolution at various wavelengths, allowing us to probe accretion
physics in this AMXP. <BR /> Methods: We study the light curve
morphology, presenting the first radio-X-ray spectral energy
Distributions (SEDs) for this source and the most detailed UV-IR
SEDs for any outbursting AMXP. We show simple models that
attempt to identify the emission mechanisms responsible for the
SEDs. We analyse short-timescale optical variability, and
compare a medium resolution optical spectrum with those from
2004. <BR /> Results: The outburst morphology is unusual for an
AMXP, comprising two peaks, the second containing a
“plateau” of
\i̊sebox-0.5ex~10 days at maximum brightness
within 30 days of the initial activity. This has implications on
duty cycles of short-period X-ray transients. The X-ray spectrum
can be fitted by a single, hard power-law. We detect optical
variability of \rs̊ebox-0.5ex~0.05 mag, on
timescales of minutes, but find no periodic modulation. In the
optical, the SEDs contain a blue component, indicative of an
irradiated disc, and a transient near-infrared (NIR) excess.
This excess is consistent with a simple model of an optically
thick synchrotron jet (as seen in other outbursting AMXPs),
however we discuss other potential origins. The optical spectrum
shows a double-peaked H\ensuremathα profile, a
diagnostic of an accretion disc, but we do not clearly see other
lines (e.g. He I, II) that were reported in 2004. <BR />
Conclusions: Optical/IR observations of AMXPs appear to be
excellent for studying the evolution of both the outer accretion
disc and the inner jet, and may eventually provide us with tight
constraints to model disc-jet coupling in accreting neutron
stars. <P />Table 5 is only available in electronic form at <A
