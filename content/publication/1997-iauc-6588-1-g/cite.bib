report: ``An R-band image (3600-s exposure) made with the ESO
New Technology Telescope on Mar. 13.0 UT shows the presence of
an extended object at R = 23.8 +/- 0.2 within 0''.2 of the
position of the optical transient reported on IAUC 6584. The
object is elongated in the north-south direction and measures
1``.3 x 1''.0 (FWHM). The point-spread function for the image
has 1``.0 FWHM. This indicates that the object is a galaxy. The
brightness of the nearby star (the position end figures for
which should have been given on IAUC 6584 as 46s.43 and 53''.0)
is R = 21.5. R- and B-band images made with the Isaac Newton
Telescope on Mar. 9.9 show an object at the position of the
optical transient whose magnitudes, R = 24.0 and B = 25.4, are
likely dominated by the above galaxy. Low-resolution
spectroscopy of the nearby star with the ESO 3.6-m telescope
shows the presence of TiO features, which together with the
color index (V-I = +2.6) indicates that it is an early M-type
dwarf unrelated to the optical transient.`` M. R. Metzger, S. R.
Kulkarni, S. G. Djorgovski, R. Gal, and C. C. Steidel,
California Institute of Technology; and D. A. Frail, National
Radio Astronomy Observatory, communicate: ''Examination of an
R-band image taken with the Keck II 10-m telescope on Mar. 6.32
UT (cf. IAUC 6582) reveals a faint source near the position of
the optical variable reported on IAUC 6584. This source appears
extended, with R = 24.0 and its center at R.A. = 5h01m46s.59,
Decl. = +11o46'53``.5 (equinox 2000.0); it is 2''.7 away from a
brighter source with R = 22.4 at position end figures 46s.40,
53``.3 (+/- 0''.2), evidently corresponding to the steady source
of Groot et al. (see above). No other sources are detected
within 5`` to R = 25.0. The extended source also appears on an
I-band image taken on Mar. 6.19 with the Palomar 1.5-m
reflector, near the detection limit of I = 21.5. From an R-band
image taken on Mar. 11.18 at the Palomar 5-m reflector, we find
that the extended source has not varied by more than 0.3 mag in
R over the interval.''},
