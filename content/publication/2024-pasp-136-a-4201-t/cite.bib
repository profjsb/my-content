 abstract = {We present the Keck Infrared Transient Survey, a NASA Key Strategic
Mission Support program to obtain near-infrared (NIR) spectra of
astrophysical transients of all types, and its first data
release, consisting of 105 NIR spectra of 50 transients. Such a
data set is essential as we enter a new era of IR astronomy with
the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) and the upcoming Nancy
Grace Roman Space Telescope (Roman). NIR spectral templates will
be essential to search JWST images for stellar explosions of the
first stars and to plan an effective Roman SN Ia cosmology
survey, both key science objectives for mission success. Between
2022 February and 2023 July, we systematically obtained 274 NIR
spectra of 146 astronomical transients, representing a
significant increase in the number of available NIR spectra in
the literature. Here, we describe the first release of data from
the 2022A semester. We systematically observed three samples: a
flux-limited sample that includes all transients <17 mag in a
red optical band (usually ZTF r or ATLAS o bands); a volume-
limited sample including all transients within redshift z < 0.01
(D \ensuremath≈ 50 Mpc); and an SN Ia sample targeting
objects at phases and light-curve parameters that had scant
existing NIR data in the literature. The flux-limited sample is
39% complete (60% excluding SNe Ia), while the volume-limited
sample is 54% complete and is 79% complete to z = 0.005.
Transient classes observed include common Type Ia and core-
collapse supernovae, tidal disruption events, luminous red
novae, and the newly categorized hydrogen-free/helium-poor
interacting Type Icn supernovae. We describe our observing
procedures and data reduction using PypeIt, which requires
minimal human interaction to ensure reproducibility.},
