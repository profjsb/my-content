 abstract = {We present early-time photometric and spectroscopic observations of
supernova (SN) 2009kr in NGC 1832. We find that its properties
to date support its classification as Type II-linear (SN II-L),
a relatively rare subclass of core-collapse supernovae (SNe). We
have also identified a candidate for the SN progenitor star
through comparison of pre-explosion, archival images taken with
WFPC2 on board the Hubble Space Telescope with SN images
obtained using adaptive optics plus NIRC2 on the 10 m Keck-II
telescope. Although the host galaxy's substantial distance
(åisebox-0.5ex~26 Mpc) results in large
uncertainties in the relative astrometry, we find that if this
candidate is indeed the progenitor, it is a highly luminous (M
$^0$ $_ V $ = -7.8 mag) yellow supergiant with initial mass
\i̊sebox-0.5ex~18-24 M $_sun$. This would be
the first time that an SN II-L progenitor has been directly
identified. Its mass may be a bridge between the upper initial
mass limit for the more common Type II-plateau SNe and the
inferred initial mass estimate for one Type II-narrow SN. <P
