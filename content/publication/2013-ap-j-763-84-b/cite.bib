 abstract = {We present new observations with the Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array of
seven X-ray-selected tidal disruption events (TDEs). The radio
observations were carried out between 9 and 22 years after the
initial X-ray discovery, and thus probe the late-time formation
of relativistic jets and jet interactions with the interstellar
medium in these systems. We detect a compact radio source in the
nucleus of the galaxy IC 3599 and a compact radio source that is
a possible counterpart to RX J1420.4+5334. We find no radio
counterparts for five other sources with flux density upper
limits between 51 and 200 \ensuremathμJy
(3\ensuremathσ). If the detections truly represent late
radio emission associated with a TDE, then our results suggest
that a fraction, &gt;åisebox-0.5ex~ 10%, of
X-ray-detected TDEs are accompanied by relativistic jets. We
explore several models for producing late radio emission,
including interaction of the jet with gas in the circumnuclear
environment (blast wave model), and emission from the core of
the jet itself. Upper limits on the radio flux density from
archival observations suggest that the jet formation may have
been delayed for years after the TDE, possibly triggered by the
accretion rate dropping below a critical threshold of
\i̊sebox-0.5ex~10$^-2$-10\̂-3\
\dot\M\_\Edd\. The non-detections are also
consistent with this scenario; deeper radio observations can
determine whether relativistic jets are present in these
systems. The emission from RX J1420.4+5334 is also consistent
with the predictions of the blast wave model; however, the radio
emission from IC 3599 is substantially underluminous, and its
spectral slope is too flat, relative to the blast wave model
expectations. Future radio monitoring of IC 3599 and RX
J1420.4+5334 will help to better constrain the nature of the
jets in these systems.},
