 abstract = {If gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) are cosmological they need not necessarily be
spatially coincident with a host galaxy--in many cosmological
models the progenitors are ejected to large distances from their
parent galaxies. While the optical transient of GRB 970228 may
be close to a faint galaxy, there are several other galaxies in
the field which could be the host if the progenitors are ejected
to Ã¥isebox-0.5ex~50 kpc. If GRBs come from
such a widely distributed progenitor population then it should
be possible to search for a statistical correlation between
optical transients and nearby galaxies. We provide a statistical
framework for quantifying a correlation between potential host
galaxies and GRBs, taking into account that galaxies are
clustered. From simulations, we estimate that if GRBs occur
within l &lt; 100 kpc of their host, then optical observations
B &lt; 24.0 of the galaxy field near just 6 optical transient
positions are required to find a correlation with potential
hosts at the 95 percent confidence level. The methodology
constructed herein is extendible to any cross-correlation
analysis and is especially useful if either set of objects is
clustered. Ultimately, if the distance scale to GRBs is
established as cosmological, this analysis can be used to
determine the spatial distribution of GRBs near their host
galaxies. <P />},
