 abstract = {From both photometric and broadband spectral monitoring of
\ensuremathÎ³-ray burst (GRB) lightcurve ``bumps,''
particularly in GRB011121, a strong case grew for a supernova
(SN) origin. The GRB-SN connection was finally solidified beyond
a reasonable doubt with the discovery that the bump in GRB030329
was spectroscopically similar to a bright Type Ic SN. In light
of this result, I re-assess the previous SN bump claims and
conclude that: 1) the distribution of GRB-SN bump peak
magnitudes is consistent with the local Type Ib/c SNe peak
distribution and 2) the late-time bumps in all long-duration
GRBs are likely supernovae. <P />},
