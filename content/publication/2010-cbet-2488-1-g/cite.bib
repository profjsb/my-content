Ofek and R. M. Quimby, CIT, report the independent discovery of
SN 2010ib (cf. CBET 2464) by the ``Palomar Transient Factory''
(PTF) group. The supernova (referred to by the PTF group as
PTF10qob) was initially detected at R-band magnitude 19.1 via
the Palomar 1.2-m Oschin Schmidt telescope on Aug. 4.38 UT,
though no object is visible at the position of 2010ib on an
image obtained on July 24.47 (limiting magnitude 20.1).},
