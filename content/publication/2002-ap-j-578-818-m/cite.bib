 abstract = {We present sequential optical spectra of the afterglow of GRB 010222
obtained 1 day apart using the Low-Resolution Imaging
Spectrometer (LRIS) and the Echellette Spectrograph and Imager
(ESI) on the Keck Telescopes. Three low-ionization absorption
systems are spectroscopically identified at z$_1$=1.47688,
z$_2$=1.15628, and z$_3$=0.92747. The higher resolution ESI
spectrum reveals two distinct components in the highest redshift
system at z$_1a$=1.47590 and z$_1b$=1.47688. We interpret
the z$_1b$=1.47688 system as an absorption feature of the disk
of the host galaxy of GRB 010222. The best-fitted power-law
optical continuum and [Zn/Cr] ratio imply low dust content or a
local gray dust component near the burst site. In addition, we
do not detect strong signatures of vibrationally excited states
of H$_2$. If the gamma-ray burst took place in a superbubble
or young stellar cluster, there are no outstanding signatures of
an ionized absorber either. Analysis of the spectral time
dependence at low resolution shows no significant evidence for
absorption-line variability. This lack of variability is
confronted with time-dependent photoionization simulations
designed to apply the observed flux from GRB 010222 to a variety
of assumed atomic gas densities and cloud radii. The absence of
time dependence in the absorption lines implies that high-
density environments are disfavored. In particular, if the GRB
environment was dust free, its density was unlikely to exceed
n$_HI$=10$^2$ cm$^-3$. If depletion of metals onto dust
is similar to Galactic values or less than solar abundances are
present, then n$_HI$&gt;=2Ã—10$^4$ cm$^-3$ is
probably ruled out in the immediate vicinity of the burst. Based
on data obtained at the W. M. Keck Observatory, which is
operated as a scientific partnership among the California
Institute of Technology, the University of California, and NASA
and was made possible with the generous financial support of the
W. M. Keck Foundation.},
