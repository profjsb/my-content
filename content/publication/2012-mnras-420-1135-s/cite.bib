 abstract = {We present photometry and spectroscopy of the peculiar Type II supernova
(SN) SN 2010jp, also named PTF10aaxi. The light curve exhibits a
linear decline with a relatively low peak absolute magnitude of
only -15.9 (unfiltered), and a low radioactive decay luminosity
at late times, which suggests a low synthesized nickel mass of M
($^56$ Ni) \ensuremathłesssim 0.003 M$_☉$. Spectra of
SN 2010jp display an unprecedented triple-peaked
H\ensuremathα line profile, showing (1) a narrow (full
width at half-maximum &gt;rsim800 km s$^-1$) central
component that suggests shock interaction with dense
circumstellar material (CSM); (2) high-velocity blue and red
emission features centred at -12 600 and +15 400 km s$^-1$,
respectively; and (3) very broad wings extending from -22 000 to
+25 000 km s$^-1$. These features persist over multiple epochs
during the ̃100 d after explosion. We propose that this line
profile indicates a bipolar jet-driven explosion, with the
central component produced by normal SN ejecta and CSM
interaction at mid and low latitudes, while the high-velocity
bumps and broad-line wings arise in a non-relativistic bipolar
jet. Two variations of the jet interpretation seem plausible:
(1) a fast jet mixes $^56$Ni to high velocities in polar zones
of the H-rich envelope; or (2) the reverse shock in the jet
produces blue and red bumps in Balmer lines when a jet interacts
with dense CSM. Jet-driven Type II SNe are predicted for
collapsars resulting from a wide range of initial masses above
25 M$_☉$, especially at subsolar metallicity. This seems
consistent with the SN host environment, which is either an
extremely low-luminosity dwarf galaxy or the very remote parts
of an interacting pair of star-forming galaxies. It also seems
consistent with the apparently low $^56$Ni mass that may
accompany black hole formation. We speculate that the jet
survives to produce observable signatures because the star's H
envelope was very low mass, having been mostly stripped away by
the previous eruptive mass-loss indicated by the Type IIn
features in the spectrum.},
