 abstract = {We present late-time Hubble Space Telescope observations of the region
surrounding the z\ensuremath≈ 4.5 gamma-ray burst
GRB000131, the highest-redshift GRB known. By making an
astrometric tie of Very Large Telescope images of the fading
afterglow to our late-time HST images we are able to localize
the GRB to better than one arcsec precision. In the near
vicinity of this localization (&lt;3 arcsec), we detect
extended emission in the F616W (
åisebox-0.5ex~R) and F805W (
\i̊sebox-0.5ex~I) filters. The brightness,
color, and morphology of this emission are consistent with its
identification as an irregular galaxy at z=4.5, and we therefore
identify it as the host galaxy of GRB000131. We present a
summary of the host galaxy properties deduced from this data,
and speculate on the unique prospects of future GRB follow-up
efforts to contribute to our understanding of galaxy and star
formation processes at high redshift. <P />},
