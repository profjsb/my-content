 abstract = {A significant proportion (̃30 per cent) of the short-duration gamma-ray
bursts (SGRBs) localized by Swift have no detected host galaxy
coincident with the burst location to deep limits, and also no
high-likelihood association with proximate galaxies on the sky.
These SGRBs may represent a population at moderately high
redshifts (z \ensuremath\gtrsim 1), for which the hosts are
faint, or a population where the progenitor has been kicked far
from its host or is sited in an outlying globular cluster. We
consider the afterglow and host observations of three `hostless'
bursts (GRBs 090305A, 091109B and 111020A), coupled with a new
observational diagnostic to aid the association of SGRBs with
putative host galaxies to investigate this issue. Considering
the well localized SGRB sample, 7/25 SGRBs can be classified as
`hostless' by our diagnostic. Statistically, however, the
proximity of these seven SGRBs to nearby galaxies is higher than
is seen for random positions on the sky. This suggests that the
majority of `hostless' SGRBs have likely been kicked from
proximate galaxies at moderate redshift. Though this result
still suggests only a small proportion of SGRBs will be within
the Advanced Laser Interferometer Gravitational Wave Observatory
horizon for neutron star-neutron star (NS) or neutron star-black
hole (BH) inspiral detection (z ̃ 0.1), in the particular case
of GRB 111020A a plausible host candidate is at z = 0.02.},
