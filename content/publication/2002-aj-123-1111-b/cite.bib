 abstract = {We present a comprehensive study to measure the locations of gamma-ray
bursts (GRBs) relative to their host galaxies. In total, we find
the offsets of 20 long-duration GRBs from their apparent host
galaxy centers by utilizing ground-based images from Palomar and
Keck and space-based images from the Hubble Space Telescope
(HST). We discuss in detail how a host galaxy is assigned to an
individual GRB and the robustness of the assignment process. The
median projected angular (physical) offset is 0.17'' (1.3 kpc).
The median offset normalized by the individual host half-light
radii is 0.98, suggesting a strong connection of GRB locations
with the UV light of their hosts. This provides strong
observational evidence for the connection of GRBs to star
formation. We further compare the observed offset distribution
with the predicted burst locations of leading stellar-mass
progenitor models. In particular, we compare the observed offset
distribution with an exponential disk, a model for the location
of collapsars and promptly bursting binaries (e.g., helium star-
black hole binaries). The statistical comparison shows good
agreement, given the simplicity of the model, with the
Kolmogorov-Smirnov probability that the observed offsets derive
from the model distribution of P$_KS$=0.45. We also compare
the observed GRB offsets with the expected offset distribution
of delayed merging remnant progenitors (black hole-neutron star
and neutron star-neutron star binaries). We find that delayed
merging remnant progenitors, insofar as the predicted offset
distributions from population synthesis studies are
representative, can be ruled out at the 2Ã—10$^-3$
level. This is arguably the strongest observational constraint
yet against delayed merging remnants as the progenitors of long-
duration GRBs. In the course of this study, we have also
discovered the putative host galaxies of GRB 990510 and GRB
990308 in archival HST data. Partially based on observations
with the NASA/ERA Hubble Space Telescope, obtained at the Space
Telescope Science Institute, which is operated by the
