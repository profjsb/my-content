 abstract = {Since the discovery of the unusual prototype SN 2002cx, the eponymous
class of Type I (hydrogen-poor) supernovae with low ejecta
speeds has grown to include approximately two dozen members
identified from several heterogeneous surveys, in some cases
ambiguously. Here we present the results of a systematic study
of 1077 Type I supernovae discovered by the Palomar Transient
Factory, leading to nine new members of this peculiar class.
Moreover, we find there are two distinct subclasses based on
their spectroscopic, photometric, and host galaxy properties:
``SN 2002cx-like'' supernovae tend to be in later-type or more
irregular hosts, have more varied and generally dimmer
luminosities, have longer rise times, and lack a Ti II trough
when compared to ``SN 2002es-like'' supernovae. None of our
objects show helium, and we counter a previous claim of two such
events. We also find that the occurrence rate of these
transients relative to Type Ia supernovae is
5.6$_-3.8$$^+22$% (90% confidence), lower compared to
earlier estimates. Combining our objects with the literature
sample, we propose that these subclasses have two distinct
physical origins.},
