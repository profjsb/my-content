 abstract = {The Ultraviolet/Optical Telescope (UVOT) on board Swift has the
capability to provide critical insight into the physics of the
early afterglows of gamma-ray bursts (GRBs). But without precise
calibration of the UVOT to standard photometric systems, it is
impossible to leverage late-time, ground-based follow-up data to
the early-time UVOT observations. In this paper, we present a
calibration of the Swift UVOT photometry to the standard Johnson
UBV system for the UVOT U, B, and V filters, and a step-by-step
photometry recipe for analyzing these data. We base our analysis
on aperture photometry performed on the ground-based and UVOT
observations of the local standard stars in the fields of
supernovae (SNe) 2005am and 2005cf and a number of Landolt
standard stars. We find that the optimal photometry aperture
radius for UVOT data is small (2.5`` for unbinned data, 3.0''
for 2×2 binned data), and we show that the
coincidence-loss (C-loss) correction is important even for
relatively faint magnitudes (16-19 mag). Based on a
theoretically motivated model, we fit the C-loss correction with
two parameters, the photometric zero point (ZP) and the
saturation magnitude (m$_\ensuremathınfty$), and derive
tight constraints for both parameters
[\ensuremathσ(ZP)=0.01 mag and
\ensuremathσ(m$_\ensuremathınfty$)=0.02 mag)].
We find that the color-term correction is not necessary for the
UVOT B and V filters but that it is necessary for the U filter
for blue objects [(U-V)&lt;0.4 mag]. We analyze the UVOT UBV
photometry of SN 2005am and find that the UVOT photometry is
generally consistent with the ground-based observations but that
a difference of up to 0.5 mag is found when the SN became faint.
We also apply our calibration results to the UVOT observations
of GRB 050603. There is a scatter of
åisebox-0.5ex~0.04-0.08 mag in our final UVOT
photometry, the cause of which is unclear, but it may be partly
due to the spatial variation in the pixel sensitivity of the
UVOT detector.},
