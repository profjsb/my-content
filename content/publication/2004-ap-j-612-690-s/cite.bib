 abstract = {We report the discovery of a transient source in the central regions of
galaxy cluster A267. The object, which we call ``PALS-1,`` was
found in a survey aimed at identifying highly magnified Lyman
break galaxies in the fields of intervening rich clusters. At
discovery, the source had U$_n$&gt;24.7 (2
\ensuremathσ AB), g=21.96+/-0.12, and very blue g-r and
r-i colors; i.e., PALS-1 was a ``U-band dropout,''
characteristic of star-forming galaxies and quasars at
zåisebox-0.5ex~3. However, 3 months later the
source had faded by more than 3 mag. Further observations showed
a continued decline in luminosity, to R&gt;26.4 at 7 months
after discovery. Although the apparent brightness suggests a
supernova at roughly the cluster redshift, we show that the
photometry and light curve argue against any known type of
supernova at any redshift. The spectral energy distribution and
location near the center of a galaxy cluster are consistent with
the hypothesis that PALS-1 is a gravitationally lensed transient
at z\i̊sebox-0.5ex~3.3. If this interpretation
is correct, the source is magnified by a factor of 4-7, and two
counterimages are predicted. Our lens model predicts that there
are time delays between the three images of 1-10 yr and that we
have witnessed the final occurrence of the transient. The
intense luminosity
(M$_AB$\rs̊ebox-0.5ex~-23.5 after correcting
for lensing) and blue UV continuum (implying
T&gt;\rae̊box-0.5ex~50,000 K) argue that the
source may have been a flare resulting from the tidal disruption
of a star by a 10$^6$-10$^8$ M$_solar$ black hole.
Regardless of its physical nature, PALS-1 highlights the
importance of monitoring regions of high magnification in galaxy
clusters for distant time-varying phenomena. <P />Based on
