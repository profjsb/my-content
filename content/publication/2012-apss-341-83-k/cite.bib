 abstract = {A Bayesian approach to calibrating period-luminosity (PL) relations has
substantial benefits over generic least-squares fits. In
particular, the Bayesian approach takes into account the full
prior distribution of the model parameters, such as the a priori
distances, and refits these parameters as part of the process of
settling on the most highly-constrained final fit. Additionally,
the Bayesian approach can naturally ingest data from multiple
wavebands and simultaneously fit the parameters of PL relations
for each waveband in a procedure that constrains the parameter
posterior distributions so as to minimize the scatter of the
final fits appropriately in all wavebands. Here we describe the
generalized approach to Bayesian model fitting and then
specialize to a detailed description of applying Bayesian linear
model fitting to the mid-infrared PL relations of RR Lyrae
variable stars. For this example application we quantify the
improvement afforded by using a Bayesian model fit. We also
compare distances previously predicted in our example
application to recently published parallax distances measured
with the Hubble Space Telescope and find their agreement to be a
vindication of our methodology. Our intent with this article is
to spread awareness of the benefits and applicability of this
Bayesian approach and encourage future PL relation
investigations to consider employing this powerful analysis
method. <P />},
