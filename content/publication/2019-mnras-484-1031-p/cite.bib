 abstract = {Wide-field optical surveys have begun to uncover large samples of fast
(t$_rise$ \ensuremathłesssim 5 d), luminous (M$_peak$
&lt; -18), blue transients. While commonly attributed to the
breakout of a supernova shock into a dense wind, the great
distances to the transients of this class found so far have
hampered detailed investigation of their properties. We present
photometry and spectroscopy from a comprehensive worldwide
campaign to observe AT 2018cow (ATLAS 18qqn), the first fast-
luminous optical transient to be found in real time at low
redshift. Our first spectra (&lt;2 days after discovery) are
entirely featureless. A very broad absorption feature suggestive
of near-relativistic velocities develops between 3 and 8 days,
then disappears. Broad emission features of H and He develop
after &gt;10 days. The spectrum remains extremely hot
throughout its evolution, and the photospheric radius contracts
with time (receding below R &lt; 10$^14$ cm after 1 month).
This behaviour does not match that of any known supernova,
although a relativistic jet within a fallback supernova could
explain some of the observed features. Alternatively, the
transient could originate from the disruption of a star by an
intermediate-mass black hole, although this would require long-
lasting emission of highly super-Eddington thermal radiation. In
either case, AT 2018cow suggests that the population of fast
luminous transients represents a new class of astrophysical
event. Intensive follow-up of this event in its late phases, and
of any future events found at comparable distance, will be
essential to better constrain their origins.},
