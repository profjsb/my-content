 abstract = {Nebular-phase spectra of SN 2006aj, discovered in coincidence with XRF
060218, were obtained with Keck in 2006 July and VLT in 2006
September. At the latter epoch spectropolarimetry was also
attempted, yielding a polarization upper limit of
åisebox-0.5ex~2%. The spectra show strong [O
I] and Mg I] emission lines, as expected in Type Ic supernovae,
but weak Ca II lines. The [Fe II] lines that were strong in SN
1998bw are much weaker in SN 2006aj, consistent with its lower
luminosity. The outer velocity of the line-emitting region is
\i̊sebox-0.5ex~8000 km s$^-1$ in July and
\rs̊ebox-0.5ex~7400 km s$^-1$ in September,
consistent with the relatively low expansion kinetic energy of
SN 2006aj. All lines have similar width, and their profiles
indicate that no major asymmetries are present in the ejecta at
velocities below v&lt;8000 km s$^-1$, except perhaps in the
innermost part. The spectra were modeled with a non-LTE code.
The mass of $^56$Ni required to power the emission is
\rae̊box-0.5ex~0.20 M$_solar$, confirming
earlier results based on the light curve. The oxygen mass is
\raib̊ox-0.5ex~1.5 M$_solar$, again much less
than in SN 1998bw, but \raiso̊x-0.5ex~0.7
M$_solar$ larger than the value derived from the early-time
modeling. The ejected mass below 8000 km s$^-1$ is
\raisex̊-0.5ex~2 M$_solar$, confirming that
SN 2006aj was only about twice as massive and energetic as the
normal Type Ic SN 1994I. The presence of a dense inner core,
containing \raiseb̊-0.5ex~1 M$_solar$ of
mostly oxygen and carbon, is inferred, as in all broad-lined SNe
Ic. This core, which may be disklike, is too deep to influence
the early light curve and too small to affect the late
polarization spectrum. <P />Based on observations made with ESO
telescopes at the Paranal and La Silla Observatories under
program 277.D-5039(A).},
