 abstract = {We present observations of the possible short GRB 180418A in
\ensuremathγ-rays, X-rays, and in the optical. Early
optical photometry with the TAROT and RATIR instruments shows a
bright peak (\ensuremath≈14.2 AB mag) between T + 28
and T + 90 s that we interpret as the signature of a reverse
shock. Later observations can be modeled by a standard forward
shock model and show no evidence of a jet break, allowing us to
constrain the jet collimation to \ensuremathþeta $_ j $
&gt; 7°. Using deep late-time optical observations,
we place an upper limit of r &gt; 24 AB mag on any underlying
host galaxy. The detection of the afterglow in the Swift UV
filters constrains the GRB redshift to z &lt; 1.3 and places an
upper bound on the \ensuremathγ-ray isotropic
equivalent energy E $_ \ensuremathγ,iso$ &lt; 3
× 10$^51$ erg. The properties of this GRB (e.g.,
duration, hardness ratio, energy, and environment) lie at the
intersection between short and long bursts, and we cannot
conclusively identify its type. We estimate that the probability
that it is drawn from the population of short GRBs is 10%-30%.},
