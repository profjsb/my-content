 abstract = {For almost a quarter of a century$^1$, the origin of
\ensuremathγ-ray bursts- brief, energetic bursts of
high-energy photons-has remained unknown. The detection of a
counterpart at another wavelength has long been thought to be a
key to understanding the nature of these bursts (see, for
example, ref. 2), but intensive searches have not revealed such
a counterpart. The distribution and properties of the
bursts$^3$ are explained naturally if they lie at cosmological
distances (a few Gpc)$^4$, but there is a countervailing view
that they are relatively local objects$^5$, perhaps
distributed in a very large halo around our Galaxy. Here we
report the detection of a transient and fading optical source in
the error box associated with the burst GRB970228, less than 21
hours after the burst$^6,7$. The optical transient appears to
be associated with a faint galaxy$^7,8$, suggesting that the
burst occurred in that galaxy and thus that
\ensuremathγ-ray bursts in general lie at cosmological
distance.},
