 abstract = {We present optical photometry and spectroscopy of the broad-lined Type
Ic supernova (SN Ic-BL) PTF10qts, which was discovered as part
of the Palomar Transient Factory. The SN was located in a dwarf
galaxy of magnitude r = 21.1 at a redshift z = 0.0907. We find
that the R-band light curve is a poor proxy for bolometric data
and use photometric and spectroscopic data to construct and
constrain the bolometric light curve. The derived bolometric
magnitude at maximum light is M$_bol$ = -18.51
\ensuremath± 0.2 mag, comparable to that of SN 1998bw
(M$_bol$ = -18.7 mag) which was associated with a gamma-ray
burst (GRB). PTF10qts is one of the most luminous SNe Ic-BL
observed without an accompanying GRB. We estimate the physical
parameters of the explosion using data from our programme of
follow-up observations, finding that it produced a larger mass
of radioactive nickel compared to other SNe Ic-BL with similar
inferred ejecta masses and kinetic energies. The progenitor of
the event was likely an ̃20 M$_☉$ star.},
