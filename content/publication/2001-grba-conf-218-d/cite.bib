 abstract = {Observations of GRB host galaxies and their environments in general can
provide valuable clues about the nature of progenitors. Bursts
are associated with faint, &lt; R &gt; ̃ 25 mag, galaxies at
cosmological redshifts, &lt; z &gt; ̃ 1. The host galaxies
span a range of luminosities and morphologies, and appear to be
broadly typical for the normal, evolving, actively star-forming
galaxy populations at comparable redshifts and magnitudes, but
may have somewhat elevated SFR per unit luminosity. There are
also spectroscopic hints of massive star formation, from the
ratios of [Ne III] and [O II] lines. The observed, unobscured
star formation rates are typically a few M_☉ /yr, but a
considerable fraction of the total star formation in the hosts
may be obscured by dust. A census of detected optical afterglows
provides a powerful new handle on the obscured fraction of star
formation in the universe; the current results suggest that at
most a half of the massive star formation was hidden by dust. <P

in Astronomy, a scientific partnership among Caltech, the Univ.
