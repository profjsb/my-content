 abstract = {Context. Active galactic nuclei (AGN) show a wealth of interesting
physical processes, some of which are poorly understood. In a
broader context, they play an important role in processes that
are far beyond their immediate surroundings, owing to the high
emitted power. <BR /> Aims: We want to address a number of open
questions, including the location and physics of the outflow
from AGN, the nature of the continuum emission, the geometry and
physical state of the X-ray broad emission line region, the Fe-K
line complex, the metal abundances of the nucleus, and finally
the interstellar medium of our own Galaxy as seen through the
signatures it imprints on the X-ray and UV spectra of AGN. <BR
/> Methods: We study one of the best targets for these aims, the
Seyfert 1 galaxy Mrk 509 with a multiwavelength campaign using
five satellites (XMM-Newton, INTEGRAL, Chandra, HST, and Swift)
and two ground-based facilities (WHT and PAIRITEL). Our
observations cover more than five decades in frequency, from 2
\ensuremathμm to 200 keV. The combination of high-
resolution spectroscopy and time variability allows us to
disentangle and study the different components. Our campaign
covers 100 days from September to December 2009, and is centred
on a simultaneous set of deep XMM-Newton and INTEGRAL
observations with regular time intervals, spanning seven weeks.
<BR /> Results: We obtain a continuous light curve in the X-ray
and UV band, showing a strong, up to 60% flux increase in the
soft X-ray band during the three weeks in the middle of our
deepest monitoring campaign, and which is correlated with an
enhancement of the UV flux. This allows us to study the time
evolution of the continuum and the outflow. By stacking the
observations, we have also obtained one of the best X-ray and UV
spectra of a Seyfert galaxy ever obtained. In this paper we also
study the effects of the spectral energy distribution (SED) that
we obtained on the photo-ionisation equilibrium. Thanks to our
broad-band coverage, uncertainties on the SED do not strongly
affect the determination of this equilibrium. <BR />
Conclusions: Here we present our very successful campaign and in
a series of subsequent papers we will elaborate on different
aspects of our study. <P />},
