 abstract = {The AGILE gamma-ray burst GRB 080514B is the first detected to have
emission above 30 MeV and an optical afterglow. However, no
spectroscopic redshift for this burst is known. We report on our
ground-based optical/NIR and millimeter follow-up observations
of this event at several observatories, including the multi-
channel imager GROND on La Silla, supplemented by Swift UVOT and
Swift XRT data. The spectral energy distribution (SED) of the
optical/NIR afterglow is found to decline sharply bluewards to
the UV bands, which can be utilized in estimating the redshift.
Fitting the SED from the Swift UVOT uvw2 band to the H band, we
estimate a photometric redshift of z=1.8$^+0.4$$_-0.3$,
which is consistent with the reported pseudo-redshift based on
gamma-ray data. We find that the afterglow properties of GRB
080514B do not differ from those exhibited by the global sample
of long bursts. Compared with the long burst sample, we conclude
that this burst was special because of its high-energy emission
properties, even though both its afterglow and host galaxy are
not remarkable in any way. Obviously, high-energy emission in
the gamma-ray band does not automatically correlate with the
occurrence of special features in the corresponding afterglow
light. <P />Appendix A is only available in electronic form at
