abstract: "R. J. Foley, D. A. Perley, D. Kocevski, and J. S. Bloom, University of California, Berkeley, report that inspection of CCD spectra (range 330-920 nm), obtained on Sept. 21 UT with the Keck I 10-m telescope (+ LRIS), shows that SN 2006eo (cf. CBET 607, IAUC 8743) is of type II in the nebular phase. Strong H_alpha emission is present with a FWHM of 5300 km/s. There is no indication of [O I] 630.0-nm, suggesting that it has recently become nebular."
