 abstract = {A fundamental challenge for wide-field imaging surveys is obtaining
follow-up spectroscopic observations: there are &gt;10$^9$
photometrically cataloged sources, yet modern spectroscopic
surveys are limited to
åisebox-0.5ex~few× 10$^6$
targets. As we approach the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope era,
new algorithmic solutions are required to cope with the data
deluge. Here we report the development of a machine-learning
framework capable of inferring fundamental stellar parameters (T
$_eff$, log g, and [Fe/H]) using photometric-brightness
variations and color alone. A training set is constructed from a
systematic spectroscopic survey of variables with Hectospec
/Multi-Mirror Telescope. In sum, the training set includes
\i̊sebox-0.5ex~9000 spectra, for which stellar
parameters are measured using the SEGUE Stellar Parameters
Pipeline (SSPP). We employed the random forest algorithm to
perform a non-parametric regression that predicts T $_eff$,
log g, and [Fe/H] from photometric time-domain observations. Our
final optimized model produces a cross-validated rms error
(RMSE) of 165 K, 0.39 dex, and 0.33 dex for T $_eff$, log g,
and [Fe/H], respectively. Examining the subset of sources for
which the SSPP measurements are most reliable, the RMSE reduces
to 125 K, 0.37 dex, and 0.27 dex, respectively, comparable to
what is achievable via low-resolution spectroscopy. For variable
stars this represents a \ensuremath≈12%-20%
improvement in RMSE relative to models trained with single-epoch
photometric colors. As an application of our method, we estimate
stellar parameters for \rs̊ebox-0.5ex~54,000
known variables. We argue that this method may convert
photometric time-domain surveys into pseudo-spectrographic
engines, enabling the construction of extremely detailed maps of
the Milky Way, its structure, and history.},
