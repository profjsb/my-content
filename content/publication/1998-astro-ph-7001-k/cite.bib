 abstract = {Supernova SN 1998bw exploded in the same direction and at the same time
as the gamma-ray burst GRB 980425. Here we report radio
observations of this type Ic supernova, beginning 4 days after
the gamma-ray burst. At its peak the radio source is the most
luminous ever seen from a supernova, nu L_nu = 4 x 103̂8 erg/s
at 5 GHz. More remarkably, the traditional synchrotron
interpretation of the radio emission requires that the radio
source be expanding at an apparent velocity of at least twice
the speed of light, indicating that this supernova was
accompanied by a shock wave moving at relativistic speed. The
energy U_e associated with the radio-emitting relativistic
electrons must lie between 10\9̂ erg &lt;U_e&lt; 10\^ ̂erg,
and thus represents a significant fraction of the total kinetic
energy åisebox-0.5ex~10\^5êrg associated
with supernova explosions. The presence of a relativistic shock
in SN 1998bw suggests a physical connection with the gamma-ray
burst GRB 980425. We argue that this represents a second class
of gamma-ray burst, with much lower emitted energy
\i̊sebox-0.5ex~10\^48r̂g in gamma-rays than
the two powerful \rs̊ebox-0.5ex~10\^53 ĝ
high-redshift gamma-ray bursts previously identified. <P />},
