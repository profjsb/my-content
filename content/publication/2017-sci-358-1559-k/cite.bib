 abstract = {Merging neutron stars offer an excellent laboratory for simultaneously
studying strong-field gravity and matter in extreme
environments. We establish the physical association of an
electromagnetic counterpart (EM170817) with gravitational waves
(GW170817) detected from merging neutron stars. By synthesizing
a panchromatic data set, we demonstrate that merging neutron
stars are a long-sought production site forging heavy elements
by r-process nucleosynthesis. The weak gamma rays seen in
EM170817 are dissimilar to classical short gamma-ray bursts with
ultrarelativistic jets. Instead, we suggest that breakout of a
wide-angle, mildly relativistic cocoon engulfing the jet
explains the low-luminosity gamma rays, the high-luminosity
ultraviolet-optical-infrared, and the delayed radio and x-ray
emission. We posit that all neutron star mergers may lead to a
wide-angle cocoon breakout, sometimes accompanied by a
successful jet and sometimes by a choked jet.},
