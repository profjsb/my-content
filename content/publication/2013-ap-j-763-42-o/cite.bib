 abstract = {The optical light curve of some supernovae (SNe) may be powered by the
outward diffusion of the energy deposited by the explosion shock
(the so-called shock breakout) in optically thick
(\ensuremathτ &gt;åisebox-0.5ex~ 30)
circumstellar matter (CSM). Recently, it was shown that the
radiation-mediated and radiation-dominated shock in an optically
thick wind must transform into a collisionless shock and can
produce hard X-rays. The X-rays are expected to peak at late
times, relative to maximum visible light. Here we report on a
search, using Swift/XRT and Chandra, for X-ray emission from 28
SNe that belong to classes whose progenitors are suspected to be
embedded in dense CSM. Our sample includes 19 Type IIn SNe, one
Type Ibn SN, and eight hydrogen-poor superluminous SNe (SLSN-I
such as SN 2005ap). Two SNe (SN 2006jc and SN 2010jl) have X-ray
properties that are roughly consistent with the expectation for
X-rays from a collisionless shock in optically thick CSM.
However, the X-ray emission from SN 2006jc can also be explained
as originating in an optically thin region. Thus, we propose
that the optical light curve of SN 2010jl is powered by shock
breakout in CSM. We suggest that two other events (SN 2010al and
SN 2011ht) were too X-ray bright during the SN maximum optical
light to be explained by the shock-breakout model. We conclude
that the light curves of some, but not all, SNe IIn/Ibn are
powered by shock breakout in CSM. For the rest of the SNe in our
sample, including all of the SLSN-I events, our X-ray limits are
not deep enough and were typically obtained too early (i.e.,
near the SN maximum light) for definitive conclusions about
their nature. Late-time X-ray observations are required in order
to further test whether these SNe are indeed embedded in dense
CSM. We review the conditions required for a shock breakout in a
wind profile. We argue that the timescale, relative to maximum
light, for the SN to peak in X-rays is a probe of the column
density and the density profile above the shock region. In SNe
whose X-ray emission slowly rises, and peaks at late times, the
optical light curve is likely powered by the diffusion of shock
energy in a dense CSM. We note that if the CSM density profile
falls faster than a constant-rate wind-density profile, then
X-rays may escape at earlier times than estimated for the wind-
profile case. Furthermore, if the CSM has a region in which the
density profile is very steep relative to a steady wind-density
profile, or if the CSM is neutral, then the radio free-free
absorption may be sufficiently low for radio emission to be
detected.},
