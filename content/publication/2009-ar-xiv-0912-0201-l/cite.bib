 abstract = {A survey that can cover the sky in optical bands over wide fields to
faint magnitudes with a fast cadence will enable many of the
exciting science opportunities of the next decade. The Large
Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST) will have an effective aperture
of 6.7 meters and an imaging camera with field of view of 9.6
deg2̂, and will be devoted to a ten-year imaging survey over
20,000 deg\ ̂south of +15 deg. Each pointing will be imaged
2000 times with fifteen second exposures in six broad bands from
0.35 to 1.1 microns, to a total point-source depth of
råisebox-0.5ex~27.5. The LSST Science Book
describes the basic parameters of the LSST hardware, software,
and observing plans. The book discusses educational and outreach
opportunities, then goes on to describe a broad range of science
that LSST will revolutionize: mapping the inner and outer Solar
System, stellar populations in the Milky Way and nearby
galaxies, the structure of the Milky Way disk and halo and other
objects in the Local Volume, transient and variable objects both
at low and high redshift, and the properties of normal and
active galaxies at low and high redshift. It then turns to far-
field cosmological topics, exploring properties of supernovae to
z\i̊sebox-0.5ex~1, strong and weak lensing, the
large-scale distribution of galaxies and baryon oscillations,
and how these different probes may be combined to constrain
cosmological models and the physics of dark energy. <P />},
