 abstract = {There is a growing number of Type IIn supernovae (SNe) which present an
outburst prior to their presumably final explosion. These
precursors may affect the SN display, and are likely related to
poorly charted phenomena in the final stages of stellar
evolution. By coadding Palomar Transient Factory (PTF) images
taken prior to the explosion, here we present a search for
precursors in a sample of 16 Type IIn SNe. We find five SNe IIn
that likely have at least one possible precursor event (PTF
10bjb, SN 2010mc, PTF 10weh, SN 2011ht, and PTF 12cxj), three of
which are reported here for the first time. For each SN we
calculate the control time. We find that precursor events among
SNe IIn are common: at the one-sided 99% confidence level,
&gt;50% of SNe IIn have at least one pre-explosion outburst
that is brighter than 3 × 10$^7$ L $_☉$ taking
place up to 1/3 yr prior to the SN explosion. The average rate
of such precursor events during the year prior to the SN
explosion is likely &gt;åisebox-0.5ex~ 1
yr$^-1$, and fainter precursors are possibly even more common.
Ignoring the two weakest precursors in our sample, the
precursors rate we find is still on the order of one per year.
We also find possible correlations between the integrated
luminosity of the precursor and the SN total radiated energy,
peak luminosity, and rise time. These correlations are expected
if the precursors are mass-ejection events, and the early-time
light curve of these SNe is powered by interaction of the SN
shock and ejecta with optically thick circumstellar material.},
