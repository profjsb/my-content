 abstract = {GRB 000926 has one of the best-studied afterglows to-date, with multiple
X-ray observations, as well as extensive multi-frequency optical
and radio coverage. Broadband afterglow observations, spanning
from X-ray to radio frequencies, provide a probe of the density
structure of the circumburst medium, as well as of the ejecta
energetics, geometry, and the physical parameters of the
relativistic blastwave resulting from the explosion. We present
an analysis of \\em Chandra X-ray Observatory\
observations of this event, along with \\em Hubble
Space Telescope\ and radio monitoring. We combine these data
with ground-based optical and IR observations and fit the
synthesized afterglow lightcurve using models where collimated
ejecta expand into a surrounding medium. We find that we can
explain the broadband lightcurve with reasonable physical
parameters only if the cooling is dominated by inverse Compton
scattering. Excess X-ray emission in the broadband spectrum
indicates that we are directly observing a contribution from
inverse Compton scattering. It is the first time this has been
observed in a GRB afterglow, and it implies that the GRB
exploded in a reasonably dense
(nåisebox-0.5ex~30 cm\̂-3\) medium,
consistent with a diffuse interstellar cloud environment. <P />},
