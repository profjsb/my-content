 abstract = {We report on intensive multiwavelength observations of the blazar Mrk
421 with the Whipple 10m telescope and supporting observations
across the electromagnetic spectrum. The observations resulted
in a data set with excellent temporal and spectral coverage.
This campaign is unique in the high level of gamma-ray coverage
obtained given the dedication of the Whipple 10m telescope to
this blazar monitoring program. Our observations also include a
large number of optical observations made with the FLWO 1.2m
telescope. Lightcurves, correlation functions and spectral
energy distribution (SED) will be presented. We discuss the
implications of these observations for various leptonic emission
models by comparing the SED to synchrotron-self-Compton and
external Compton models. <P />},
