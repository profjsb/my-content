 abstract = {We present the results of a machine-learning (ML)-based search for new R
Coronae Borealis (RCB) stars and DY Persei-like stars (DYPers)
in the Galaxy using cataloged light curves from the All-Sky
Automated Survey (ASAS) Catalog of Variable Stars (ACVS). RCB
stars—a rare class of hydrogen-deficient carbon-rich
supergiants—are of great interest owing to the
insights they can provide on the late stages of stellar
evolution. DYPers are possibly the low-temperature, low-
luminosity analogs to the RCB phenomenon, though additional
examples are needed to fully establish this connection. While
RCB stars and DYPers are traditionally identified by epochs of
extreme dimming that occur without regularity, the ML search
framework more fully captures the richness and diversity of
their photometric behavior. We demonstrate that our ML method
can use newly discovered RCB stars to identify additional
candidates within the same data set. Our search yields 15
candidates that we consider likely RCB stars/DYPers: new
spectroscopic observations confirm that four of these candidates
are RCB stars and four are DYPers. Our discovery of four new
DYPers increases the number of known Galactic DYPers from two to
six; noteworthy is that one of the new DYPers has a measured
parallax and is m \ensuremath≈ 7 mag, making it the
brightest known DYPer to date. Future observations of these new
DYPers should prove instrumental in establishing the RCB
connection. We consider these results, derived from a machine-
learned probabilistic classification catalog, as an important
proof-of-concept for the efficient discovery of rare sources
with time-domain surveys.},
