 abstract = {The optical afterglow of long-duration GRB 071003 is among the brightest
yet to be detected from any GRB, with R \ensuremathâ‰ˆ
12 mag in KAIT observations starting 42 s after the GRB trigger,
including filtered detections during prompt emission. However,
our high-S/N afterglow spectrum displays only extremely weak
absorption lines at what we argue is the host redshift of z =
1.60435, in contrast to the three other, much stronger Mg II
absorption systems observed at lower redshifts. Together with
Keck adaptive optics observations, which fail to reveal a host
galaxy coincident with the burst position, our observations
suggest a halo progenitor and offer a cautionary tale about the
use of Mg II for GRB redshift determination. We present early-
through late-time observations spanning the electromagnetic
spectrum, constrain the connection between the prompt emission
and early variations in the light curve (we observe no
correlation), and discuss possible origins for an unusual,
marked rebrightening that occurs a few hours after the burst:
likely either a late-time refreshed shock or a wide-angle
secondary jet. Analysis of the late-time afterglow is most
consistent with a wind environment, suggesting a massive star
progenitor. Together with GRB 070125, this may indicate that a
small but significant portion of star formation in the early
universe occurred far outside what we consider a normal galactic
disk.},
