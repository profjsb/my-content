 abstract = {RATIR (The Reionization and Transients Infrared Camera/Telescope) is an
optical infrared camera in the 1.5 m telescope in the Mexican
National Astronomical Observatory, OAN, in San Pedro Martir,
Baja California. The primary goal of RATIR is to remotely
observe Gamma Ray Bursts as detected by the SWIFT satellite.
This document describes the problem definition, the mechanical
calculations, the conceptual design, the finite element
analysis, the different configurations proposed and the
mechanical performance of the main Support Structure and
Dichroic Mounts for RATIR. <P />},
