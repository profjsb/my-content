 abstract = {We present a sample of 77 optical afterglows (OAs) of Swift detected
gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) for which spectroscopic follow-up
observations have been secured. Our first objective is to
measure the redshifts of the bursts. For the majority (90%) of
the afterglows, the redshifts have been determined from the
spectra. We provide line lists and equivalent widths (EWs) for
all detected lines redward of Ly\ensuremathα covered by
the spectra. In addition to the GRB absorption systems, these
lists include line strengths for a total of 33 intervening
absorption systems. We discuss to what extent the current sample
of Swift bursts with OA spectroscopy is a biased subsample of
all Swift detected GRBs. For that purpose we define an X-ray-
selected statistical sample of Swift bursts with optimal
conditions for ground-based follow-up from the period 2005 March
to 2008 September; 146 bursts fulfill our sample criteria. We
derive the redshift distribution for the statistical (X-ray
selected) sample and conclude that less than 18% of Swift
bursts can be at z &gt; 7. We compare the high-energy
properties (e.g., \ensuremathγ-ray (15-350 keV) fluence
and duration, X-ray flux, and excess absorption) for three
subsamples of bursts in the statistical sample: (1) bursts with
redshifts measured from OA spectroscopy; (2) bursts with
detected optical and/or near-IR afterglow, but no afterglow-
based redshift; and (3) bursts with no detection of the OA. The
bursts in group (1) have slightly higher
\ensuremathγ-ray fluences and higher X-ray fluxes and
significantly less excess X-ray absorption than bursts in the
other two groups. In addition, the fractions of dark bursts,
defined as bursts with an optical to X-ray slope
\ensuremathβ$_OX$ &lt; 0.5, is 14% in group (1),
38% in group (2), and &gt;39% in group (3). For the full
sample, the dark burst fraction is constrained to be in the
range 25%-42%. From this we conclude that the sample of GRBs
with OA spectroscopy is not representative for all Swift bursts,
most likely due to a bias against the most dusty sight lines.
This should be taken into account when determining, e.g., the
redshift or metallicity distribution of GRBs and when using GRBs
as a probe of star formation. Finally, we characterize GRB
absorption systems as a class and compare them to QSO absorption
systems, in particular the damped Ly\ensuremathα
absorbers (DLAs). On average GRB absorbers are characterized by
significantly stronger EWs for H I as well as for both low and
high ionization metal lines than what is seen in intervening QSO
absorbers. However, the distribution of line strengths is very
broad and several GRB absorbers have lines with EWs well within
the range spanned by QSO-DLAs. Based on the 33 z &gt; 2 bursts
in the sample, we place a 95% confidence upper limit of 7.5%
on the mean escape fraction of ionizing photons from star-
forming galaxies. <P />Based on observations collected at the
