 abstract = {We revisit echelle spectra (spectral resolution R \ensuremath≈
40,000) of eight gamma-ray burst (GRB) afterglows to obtain the
incidence (dN/dz) of weak intervening Mg II systems at a mean
redshift of langzrang = 1.5. We show that dN/dz of systems
having rest-frame equivalent widths 0.07 ̊A
\ensuremathłeq W_r\̂Mg II\ &lt; 1 \Å toward GRBs
is statistically consistent with the incidence toward quasi-
stellar objects (QSOs). Our result is in contrast to the results
for Mg II systems having W$_r$ &gt;= 1 \r̊, where dN/dz
toward GRBs has been found to be larger than toward QSOs by a
factor of \ensuremath≈4. We confirm the overdensity
albeit at a factor of \ensuremath≈3 only. This
suggests that any explanation for the GRB/QSO discrepancy, be it
intrinsic to the absorbers or a selection effect, should be
inherent only to the galaxies that host strong absorbers in the
line of sight to GRBs. We argue that, of all scenarios that have
been proposed, lensing amplification is the one that could
explain the strong Mg II enhancement while allowing for no
significant enhancement in the weak absorbers.},
