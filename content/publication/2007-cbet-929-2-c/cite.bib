 abstract = {R. Chornock, A. V. Filippenko, R. J. Foley, D. A. Perley, J. M.
Silverman, J. S. Bloom, D. Kocevski, and W. Li, University of
California, Berkeley, report that CCD spectra (range 310-920 nm)
of 2007bi were obtained on Apr. 15.6 and 16.4 UT with LRIS on
the Keck I 10-m telescope under poor conditions. They identify
weak narrow emission features near 420.1 and 739.7 nm with [O
II] 372.7-nm and H-alpha (respectively) nebular emission lines
from the host galaxy at a redshift of 0.127. After removal of
this redshift, the object bears a striking resemblance to the
peculiar type-Ic supernova 1999as (Knop et al. 1999, IAUC 7128;
Hatano et al. 2001, Bull. AAS 198, 3902) at 25 days past
discovery, with an additional strong emission feature near 731
nm (FWHM about 6000 km/s). Absorption features identified as Ca
II H and K, as well as Fe II (492.4, 501.8, and 516.9 nm), are
present -- blueshifted by 12000 km/s. The Fe II absorptions are
unusually narrow (FWHM about 3000 km/s). Assuming a distance
modulus at this redshift of 38.8, the supernova is quite
luminous (absolute magnitude -20.5). A faint galaxy, presumably
the host, is present in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (Adelman-
McCarthy et al. 2006, Ap.J. Suppl. 162, 38) within 1 arcsec of
the position of the supernova, with an absolute g magnitude of
M_g = -16.4. The relatively narrow Fe II absorptions, high
luminosity of the supernova, and faint host luminosity are all
similar to that of SN 1999as.},
