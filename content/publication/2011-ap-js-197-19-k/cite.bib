 abstract = {We present ground-based spectroscopic verification of 6 Y dwarfs (see
also Cushing et al.), 89 T dwarfs, 8 L dwarfs, and 1 M dwarf
identified by the Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE).
Eighty of these are cold brown dwarfs with spectral types
&gt;=T6, six of which have been announced earlier by Mainzer et
al. and Burgasser et al. We present color-color and color-type
diagrams showing the locus of M, L, T, and Y dwarfs in WISE
color space. Near-infrared and, in a few cases, optical spectra
are presented for these discoveries. Near-infrared
classifications as late as early Y are presented and objects
with peculiar spectra are discussed. Using these new
discoveries, we are also able to extend the optical T dwarf
classification scheme from T8 to T9. After deriving an absolute
WISE 4.6 \ensuremathμm (W2) magnitude versus spectral type
relation, we estimate spectrophotometric distances to our
discoveries. We also use available astrometric measurements to
provide preliminary trigonometric parallaxes to four of our
discoveries, which have types of L9 pec (red), T8, T9, and Y0;
all of these lie within 10 pc of the Sun. The Y0 dwarf, WISE
1541-2250, is the closest at 2.8$^+1.3$ $_-0.6$ pc if this
2.8 pc value persists after continued monitoring, WISE 1541-2250
will become the seventh closest stellar system to the Sun.
Another 10 objects, with types between T6 and &gt;Y0, have
spectrophotometric distance estimates also placing them within
10 pc. The closest of these, the T6 dwarf WISE 1506+7027, is
believed to fall at a distance of
åisebox-0.5ex~4.9 pc. WISE multi-epoch
positions supplemented with positional info primarily from the
Spitzer/Infrared Array Camera allow us to calculate proper
motions and tangential velocities for roughly one-half of the
new discoveries. This work represents the first step by WISE to
complete a full-sky, volume-limited census of late-T and Y
dwarfs. Using early results from this census, we present
preliminary, lower limits to the space density of these objects
and discuss constraints on both the functional form of the mass
function and the low-mass limit of star formation.},
