abstract: "We present optical and near-infrared (NIR) light curves and optical spectra of SN 2013dx, associated with the nearby (redshift 0.145) gamma-ray burst GRB 130702A. The prompt isotropic gamma- ray energy released from GRB 130702A is measured to be E$_γ ,iso$=6.4$_-1.0$$^+1.3$× 10$^50$ erg (1 keV to 10 MeV in the rest frame), placing it intermediate between low-luminosity GRBs like GRB 980425/SN 1998bw and the broader cosmological population. We compare the observed g'r'I' z' light curves of SN 2013dx to a SN 1998bw template, finding that SN 2013dx evolves ̃20% faster (steeper rise time), with a comparable peak luminosity. Spectroscopically, SN 2013dx resembles other broad-lined SNe Ic, both associated with (SN 2006aj and SN 1998bw) and lacking (SN 1997ef, SN 2007I, and SN 2010ah) gamma-ray emission, with photospheric velocities around peak of ̃ 21,000 km s$^-1$. We construct a quasi-bolometric (g'r'$^I'z'y) light curve for SN 2013dx, only the fifth GRB- associated SN with extensive NIR coverage and the third with a bolometric light curve extending beyond Δ t&gt; 40 days. Together with the measured photospheric velocity, we derive basic explosion parameters using simple analytic models. We infer a <SUP>56$Ni mass of M$_Ni$=0.37+/- 0.01 M$_☉ $, an ejecta mass of M$_ej$=3.1+/- 0.1 M$_☉ $, and a kinetic energy of E$_K$=(8.2+/- 0.43)× 10$^51$ erg (statistical uncertainties only), consistent with previous GRB-associated supernovae. When considering the ensemble population of GRB-associated supernovae, we find no correlation between the mass of synthesized $^56$Ni and high- energy properties, despite clear predictions from numerical simulations that M$_Ni$ should correlate with the degree of asymmetry. On the other hand, M$_Ni$ clearly correlates with the kinetic energy of the supernova ejecta across a wide range of core-collapse events.</SUP>"
