 abstract = {We show that several GRB correlations have common features indicative of
an origin in selection effects. We focus on the possible origin
of the Epk-Eiso correlation in Swift data due to detector
threshold truncation. The existence of faint Swift events calls
into question inferences based on pre-Swift surveys which must
be subject to complicated incompleteness effects. Also, we show
that the Epk-E$_\ensuremathÎ³$ (``Ghirlanda'')
correlation is effectively independent of the GRB redshifts z,
which suggests it contains little intrinsic physics. <P />},
