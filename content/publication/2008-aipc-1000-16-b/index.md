abstract: "We show that several GRB correlations have common features indicative of an origin in selection effects. We focus on the possible origin of the Epk-Eiso correlation in Swift data due to detector threshold truncation. The existence of faint Swift events calls into question inferences based on pre-Swift surveys which must be subject to complicated incompleteness effects. Also, we show that the Epk-E$_Î³$ (``Ghirlanda'') correlation is effectively independent of the GRB redshifts z, which suggests it contains little intrinsic physics. <P />"
