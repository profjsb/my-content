 abstract = {We report here the discovery by the Intermediate Palomar Transient
Factory (iPTF) of iPTF14yb, a luminous
(\\M\$_r$\\ensuremath≈ -27.8 mag), cosmological
(redshift 1.9733), rapidly fading optical transient. We
demonstrate, based on probabilistic arguments and a comparison
with the broader population, that iPTF14yb is the optical
afterglow of the long-duration gamma-ray burst GRB 140226A. This
marks the first unambiguous discovery of a GRB afterglow prior
to (and thus entirely independent of) an associated high-energy
trigger. We estimate the rate of iPTF14yb-like sources (i.e.,
cosmologically distant relativistic explosions) based on iPTF
observations, inferring an all-sky value of \\\Re
\$_rel$\=610 yr$^-1$ (68% confidence interval of 110-2000
yr$^-1$). Our derived rate is consistent (within the large
uncertainty) with the all-sky rate of on-axis GRBs derived by
the Swift satellite. Finally, we briefly discuss the
implications of the nondetection to date of bona fide
“orphan” afterglows (i.e.,
those lacking detectable high-energy emission) on GRB beaming
and the degree of baryon loading in these relativistic jets.},
