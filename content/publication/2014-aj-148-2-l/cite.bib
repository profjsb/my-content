 abstract = {We present a template-fitting algorithm for determining photometric
redshifts, z $_phot$, of candidate high-redshift gamma-ray
bursts (GRBs). Using afterglow photometry, obtained by the
Reionization and Transients InfraRed (RATIR) camera, this
algorithm accounts for the intrinsic GRB afterglow spectral
energy distribution, host dust extinction, and the effect of
neutral hydrogen (local and cosmological) along the line of
sight. We present the results obtained by this algorithm and the
RATIR photometry of GRB 130606A, finding a range of best-fit
solutions, 5.6 &lt; z $_phot$ &lt; 6.0, for models of
several host dust extinction laws (none, the Milky Way, Large
Magellanic Clouds, and Small Magellanic Clouds), consistent with
spectroscopic measurements of the redshift of this GRB. Using
simulated RATIR photometry, we find that our algorithm provides
precise measures of z $_phot$ in the ranges of 4 &lt; z
$_phot$ &lt;åisebox-0.5ex~ 8 and 9 &lt; z
$_phot$ &lt; 10 and can robustly determine when z $_phot$
&gt; 4. Further testing highlights the required caution in
cases of highly dust-extincted host galaxies. These tests also
show that our algorithm does not erroneously find z $_phot$
&lt; 4 when z $_sim$ &gt; 4, thereby minimizing false
negatives and allowing us to rapidly identify all potential
high-redshift events.},
