 abstract = {The 26 long-duration gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) with known redshifts form a
distinct cosmological set, selected differently than other
cosmological probes such as quasars and galaxies. Since the
progenitors are now believed to be connected with active star
formation and since burst emission penetrates dust, one hope is
that with a uniformly selected sample, the large-scale redshift
distribution of GRBs can help constrain the star formation
history of the universe. However, we show that strong
observational biases in ground-based redshift discovery hamper a
clean determination of the large-scale GRB rate and hence the
connection of GRBs to the star formation history. We then focus
on the properties of the small-scale (clustering) distribution
of GRB redshifts. When corrected for heliocentric motion
relative to the local Hubble flow, the observed redshifts appear
to show a propensity for clustering: eight of 26 GRBs occurred
within a recession velocity difference of 1000 km s$^-1$ of
another GRB. That is, four pairs of GRBs occurred within 30
h$^-1$$_65$ Myr in cosmic time, despite being causally
separated on the sky. We investigate the significance of this
clustering using a simulation that accounts for at least some of
the strong observational and intrinsic biases in redshift
discovery. Comparison of the numbers of close redshift pairs
expected from the simulation with that observed shows no
significant small-scale clustering excess in the present sample;
however, the four close pairs occur in only about 20% of the
simulated data sets (the precise significance of the clustering
is dependent on the modeled biases). We conclude with some
impetuses and suggestions for future precise GRB redshift
measurements.},
