 abstract = {The ability to generate physically plausible ensembles of variable
sources is critical to the optimization of time domain survey
cadences and the training of classification models on data sets
with few to no labels. Traditional data augmentation techniques
expand training sets by reenvisioning observed exemplars,
seeking to simulate observations of specific training sources
under different (exogenous) conditions. Unlike fully theory-
driven models, these approaches do not typically allow
principled interpolation nor extrapolation. Moreover, the
principal drawback of theory-driven models lies in the
prohibitive computational cost of simulating source observables
from ab initio parameters. In this work, we propose a
computationally tractable machine learning approach to generate
realistic light curves of periodic variables capable of
integrating physical parameters and variability classes as
inputs. Our deep generative model, inspired by the transparent
latent space generative adversarial networks, uses a variational
autoencoder (VAE) architecture with temporal convolutional
network layers, trained using the OGLE-III optical light curves
and physical characteristics (e.g., effective temperature and
absolute magnitude) from Gaia DR2. A test using the temperature-
shape relationship of RR Lyrae demonstrates the efficacy of our
generative ``physics-enhanced latent space VAE'' (PELS-VAE)
model. Such deep generative models, serving as nonlinear
nonparametric emulators, present a novel tool for astronomers to
create synthetic time series over arbitrary cadences.},
