 abstract = {Cosmic \ensuremathγ-ray bursts are one of the great frontiers
of astrophysics today. They are a playground of relativists and
observers alike. They may teach us about the death of stars and
the birth of black holes, the physics in extreme conditions, and
help us probe star formation in the distant and obscured
universe. In this review we summarise some of the remarkable
progress in this field over the past few years. While the nature
of the GRB progenitors is still unsettled, it now appears likely
that at least some bursts originate in explosions of very
massive stars, or at least occur in or near the regions of
massive star formation. The physics of the burst afterglows is
reasonably well understood, and has been tested and confirmed
very well by the observations. Bursts are found to be beamed,
but with a broad range of jet opening angles; the mean
\ensuremathγ-ray energies after the beaming corrections
are åisebox-0.5ex~ 10$^51$ erg. Bursts are
associated with faint (&lt;R&gt;
\i̊sebox-0.5ex~ 25 mag) galaxies at
cosmological redshifts, with &lt;z&gt;
\rs̊ebox-0.5ex~ 1. The host galaxies span a
range of luminosities and morphologies, but appear to be broadly
typical for the normal, actively star-forming galaxy populations
at comparable redshifts and magnitudes. Some of the challenges
for the future include: the nature of the short bursts and
possibly other types of bursts and transients; use of GRBs to
probe the obscured star formation in the universe, and possibly
as probes of the very early universe; and their detection as
sources of high-energy particles and gravitational waves. <P />},
