 abstract = {We present extensive photometry at ultraviolet (UV), optical, and near-
infrared (NIR) wavelengths, as well as dense sampling of optical
spectra, for the normal Type Ia supernova (SN Ia) 2005cf. The
optical photometry, performed at eight different telescopes,
shows a 1\ensuremathσ scatter of lsim0.03 mag after
proper corrections for the instrument responses. From the well-
sampled light curves, we find that SN 2005cf reached a B-band
maximum at 13.63 \ensuremath± 0.02 mag, with an observed
luminosity decline rate \ensuremathΔm $_15$(B) = 1.05
\ensuremath± 0.03 mag. The correlations between the
decline rate and various color indexes, recalibrated on the
basis of an expanded SN Ia sample, yield a consistent estimate
for the host-galaxy reddening of SN 2005cf, E(B - V)$_host$ =
0.10 \ensuremath± 0.03 mag. The UV photometry was obtained
with the Hubble Space Telescope and the Swift
Ultraviolet/Optical Telescope, and the results match each other
to within 0.1-0.2 mag. The UV light curves show similar
evolution to the broadband U, with an exception in the 2000-2500
̊A spectral range (corresponding to the F220W/uvm2
filters), where the light curve appears broader and much fainter
than that on either side (likely owing to the intrinsic spectral
evolution). Combining the UV data with the ground-based optical
and NIR data, we establish the generic UV-optical-NIR bolometric
light curve for SN 2005cf and derive the bolometric corrections
in the absence of UV and/or NIR data. The overall spectral
evolution of SN 2005cf is similar to that of a normal SN Ia, but
with variety in the strength and profile of the main feature
lines. The spectra at early times displayed strong, high-
velocity (HV) features in the Ca II H&amp;K doublet and NIR
triplet, which were distinctly detached from the photosphere (v
\ensuremath≈ 10,000 km s$^-1$) at a velocity ranging
from 20,000 to 25,000 km s$^-1$. One interesting feature is
the flat-bottomed absorption observed near 6000 \Å in the
earliest spectrum, which rapidly evolved into a triangular shape
and then became a normal Si II \ensuremathłambda6355
absorption profile at about one week before maximum brightness.
This premaximum spectral evolution is perhaps due to the
blending of the Si II\ensuremathłambda6355 at photospheric
velocity and another HV absorption component (e.g., an Si II
shell at a velocity \rs̊ebox-0.5ex~18,000 km
s$^-1$) in the outer ejecta, and may be common in other normal
SNe Ia. The possible origin of the HV absorption features is
briefly discussed.},
