 abstract = {In the last years the research on GRB host galaxies has proceeded to
more detailed studies both using high resolution afterglow
spectroscopy and spatially resolved spectra of nearby hosts.
High resolution spectra give a detailed picture of the kinematic
properties of matter along the line-of-sight in the host. Two
afterglow spectra show clear indications for outflows from their
host, namely GRB 030329 and GRB 060206, derived from the
position of absorption and host emission lines, nonvariability
of Mg I and the radiation field calculated from fine-structure
line detections. In nearby GRB hosts it is possible to resolve
the actual GRB site. GRB 060505, a SN-less GRB, originated in a
relatively metal poor, star forming region with similar
properties as other long-duration hosts. A similar conclusion is
reached for the site of GRB 980425/SN 1998 bw. <P />},
