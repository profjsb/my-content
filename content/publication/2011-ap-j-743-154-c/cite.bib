 abstract = {Understanding the origin and diversity of emission processes responsible
for gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) remains a pressing challenge. While
prompt and contemporaneous panchromatic observations have the
potential to test predictions of the internal-external shock
model, extensive multiband imaging has been conducted for only a
few GRBs. We present rich, early-time, multiband data sets for
two Swift events, GRB 110205A and GRB 110213A. The former shows
optical emission since the early stages of the prompt phase,
followed by the steep rising in flux up to
åisebox-0.5ex~1000 s after the burst (t
$^-\ensuremathα$ with \ensuremathα = -6.13
\ensuremath± 0.75). We discuss this feature in the context
of the reverse-shock scenario and interpret the following single
power-law decay as being forward-shock dominated. Polarization
measurements, obtained with the RINGO2 instrument mounted on the
Liverpool Telescope, also provide hints on the nature of the
emitting ejecta. The latter event, instead, displays a very
peculiar optical to near-infrared light curve, with two
achromatic peaks. In this case, while the first peak is probably
due to the onset of the afterglow, we interpret the second peak
to be produced by newly injected material, signifying a late-
time activity of the central engine.},
