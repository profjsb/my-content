 abstract = {We present light curves of the afterglow of GRB 050502A, including very
early data at t-t$_GRB$&lt;60 s. The light curve is composed
of unfiltered ROTSE-IIIb optical observations from 44 s to 6 hr
postburst, R-band MDM observations from 1.6 to 8.4 hr postburst,
and PAIRITEL JHK$_s$ observations from 0.6 to 2.6 hr
postburst. The optical light curve is fit by a broken power law,
where t$^\ensuremathα$ steepens from
\ensuremathα=-1.13+/-0.02 to -1.44+/-0.02 at
åisebox-0.5ex~5700 s. This steepening is
consistent with the evolution expected for the passage of the
cooling frequency \ensuremathν$_c$ through the optical
band. Even in our earliest observation at 44 s postburst, there
is no evidence that the optical flux is brighter than a backward
extrapolation of the later power law would suggest. The observed
decay indices and spectral index are consistent with either an
ISM or a wind fireball model, but slightly favor the ISM
interpretation. The expected spectral index in the ISM
interpretation is consistent within 1 \ensuremathσ with
the observed spectral index \ensuremathβ=-0.8+/-0.1 the
wind interpretation would imply a spectral index slightly
(\i̊sebox-0.5ex~2 \ensuremathσ)
shallower than observed. A small amount of dust extinction at
the source redshift could steepen an intrinsic spectrum
sufficiently to account for the observed value of
\ensuremathβ. In this picture, the early optical decay,
with the peak at or below 4.7×10$^14$ Hz at 44 s,
requires very small electron and magnetic energy partitions from
the fireball.},
