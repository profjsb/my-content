abstract: The transition from prompt to afterglow emission is one of the most exciting
  and least understood phases in gamma-ray bursts (GRBs). Correlations among optical,
  X-ray, and gamma-ray emission in GRBs have been explored, to attempt to answer whether
  the earliest optical emission comes from internal and/or external shocks. We present
  optical photometric observations of GRB 180325A collected with the TAROT and RATIR
  ground-based telescopes. These observations show two strong optical flashes with
  separate peaks at ensuremath∼50 and ensuremath∼120 s, followed by a temporally extended
  optical emission. We also present X-rays and gamma-ray observations of GRB 180325A,
  detected by the Burst Alert Telescope and X-ray Telescope, on the Neil Gehrels Swift
  observatory, which both observed a narrow flash at ensuremath∼80 s. We show that
  the prompt gamma-ray and X-ray early emission shares similar temporal and spectral
  features consistent with internal dissipation within the relativistic outflow (e.g.,
  by internal shocks or magnetic reconnection), while the early optical flashes are
  likely generated by the reverse shock that decelerates the ejecta as it sweeps up
  the external medium.
