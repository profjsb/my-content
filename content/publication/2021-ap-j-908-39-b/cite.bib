 abstract = {The transition from prompt to afterglow emission is one of the most
exciting and least understood phases in gamma-ray bursts (GRBs).
Correlations among optical, X-ray, and gamma-ray emission in
GRBs have been explored, to attempt to answer whether the
earliest optical emission comes from internal and/or external
shocks. We present optical photometric observations of GRB
180325A collected with the TAROT and RATIR ground-based
telescopes. These observations show two strong optical flashes
with separate peaks at \ensuremath∼50 and
\ensuremath∼120 s, followed by a temporally extended
optical emission. We also present X-rays and gamma-ray
observations of GRB 180325A, detected by the Burst Alert
Telescope and X-ray Telescope, on the Neil Gehrels Swift
observatory, which both observed a narrow flash at
\ensuremath∼80 s. We show that the prompt gamma-ray and
X-ray early emission shares similar temporal and spectral
features consistent with internal dissipation within the
relativistic outflow (e.g., by internal shocks or magnetic
reconnection), while the early optical flashes are likely
generated by the reverse shock that decelerates the ejecta as it
sweeps up the external medium.},
