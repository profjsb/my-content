 abstract = {The Peters Automated Infrared Imaging Telescope (PAIRITEL) is the first
meter-class telescope operating as a fully robotic IR imaging
system. Dedicated in October 2004, PAIRITEL began regular
observations in mid-December 2004 as part of a 1.5 year
commissioning period. The system was designed to respond without
human intervention to new gamma-ray burst transients: this
milestone was finally reached on November 9, 2005 but the
telescope had a number of semi-automated sub-10 minute responses
throughout early commissioning. When not operating in Target of
Opportunity mode, PAIRITEL performs a number of queue scheduled
transient monitoring campaigns. To achieve this level of
automation, we have developed communicating tools to connect the
various sub-systems: an intelligent queue scheduling database,
run-time configurable observation sequence software, a data
reduction pipeline, and a master state machine which monitors
and controls all functions within and affecting the observatory.
