 abstract = {Knowledge of the properties of \ensuremathγ-ray bursts has
increased substantially following recent detections of
counterparts at X-ray, optical and radio wavelengths. But the
nature of the underlying physical mechanism that powers these
sources remains unclear. In this context, an important question
is the total energy in the burst, for which an accurate estimate
of the distance is required. Possible host galaxies have been
identified for the first two optical counterparts discovered,
and a lower limit obtained for the redshift of one of them,
indicating that the bursts lie at cosmological distances. A host
galaxy of the third optically detected burst has now been
identified and its redshift determined to be z = 3.42. When
combined with the measured flux of \ensuremathγ-rays
from the burst, this large redshift implies an energy of
3× 10$^53$erg in the \ensuremathγ-rays
alone, if the emission is isotropic. This is much larger than
the energies hitherto considered, and it poses a challenge for
theoretical models of the bursts.},
