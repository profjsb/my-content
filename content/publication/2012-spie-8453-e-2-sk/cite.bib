 abstract = {The Reionization And Transients InfraRed (RATIR) camera has been built
for rapid Gamma-Ray Burst (GRB) followup and will provide quasi-
simultaneous imaging in ugriZY JH. The optical component uses
two 2048 × 2048 pixel Finger Lakes Imaging ProLine
detectors, one optimized for the SDSS u, g, and r bands and one
optimized for the SDSS i band. The infrared portion incorporates
two 2048 × 2048 pixel Teledyne HgCdTe HAWAII-2RG
detectors, one with a 1.7-micron cutoff and one with a
2.5-micron cutoff. The infrared detectors are controlled by
Teledyne's SIDECAR (System for Image Digitization Enhancement
Control And Retrieval) ASICs (Application Specific Integrated
Circuits). While other ground-based systems have used the
SIDECAR before, this system also utilizes Teledyne's JADE2 (JWST
ASIC Drive Electronics) interface card and IDE (Integrated
Development Environment). Here we present a summary of the
software developed to interface the RATIR detectors with Remote
Telescope System, 2nd Version (RTS2) software. RTS2 is an
integrated open source package for remote observatory control
under the Linux operating system and will autonomously
coordinate observatory dome, telescope pointing, detector,
filter wheel, focus stage, and dewar vacuum compressor
operations. Where necessary we have developed custom interfaces
between RTS2 and RATIR hardware, most notably for cryogenic
focus stage motor drivers and temperature controllers. All
detector and hardware interface software developed for RATIR is
freely available and open source as part of the RTS2
distribution. <P />},
