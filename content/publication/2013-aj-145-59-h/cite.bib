 abstract = {We report extensive new photometry and spectroscopy of the highly
variable young stellar object PTF 10nvg (also known as IRAS
20496+4354 and V2492 Cyg), including optical and near-infrared
time-series data as well as mid-infrared and millimeter data.
Following the previously reported 2010 rise to R $_PTF$
lsim13.ͫ5 and subsequent fade, during 2011 and 2012 the source
underwent additional episodes of brightening, followed by
several magnitude dimming events including prolonged faint
states at R $_PTF$ &gt;åisebox-0.5ex~
20$^m$. The observed high-amplitude variations are largely
consistent with extinction changes (\ensuremathΔA$_V$
up to 30 mag) having a \i̊sebox-0.5ex~220 day
quasi-periodic signal. However, photometry measured when the
source was near maximum brightness in mid-2010 as well as in
late-2012 does not phase well to this period. Spectral evolution
includes not only changes in the spectral slope but also
correlated variation in the prominence of TiO/VO/CO bands and
atomic line emission, as well as anti-correlated variation in
forbidden line emission which, along with H$_2$, dominates
optical and infrared spectra at faint epochs. Notably, night-to-
night variations in several forbidden doublet strengths and
ratios are observed. High-dispersion spectra were obtained in a
variety of photometric states and reveal time-variable line
profiles. Neutral and singly ionized atomic species are likely
formed in an accretion flow and/or impact while the origin of
zero-velocity atomic Li I \ensuremathłambda6707 in emission
is unknown. Forbidden lines, including several rare species,
exhibit blueshifted emission profiles and likely arise from an
outflow/jet. Several of these lines are also seen spatially
offset from the continuum source position, presumably in a
shocked region of an extended jet. Blueshifted absorption
components of the Na I D doublet, K I
\ensuremathłambda\ensuremathłambda7665, 7669 doublet,
and the O I 7774 triplet, as well as blueshifted absorption
components seen against the broad H\ensuremathα and Ca
II triplet emission lines, similarly are formed in the outflow.
CARMA maps resolve on larger scales a spatially extended outflow
in millimeter-wavelength CO. We attribute the recently observed
photometric and spectroscopic behavior to rotating circumstellar
disk material located at separation a \ensuremath≈
0.7(M $_*$/M $_☉$)$^1/3$ AU from the continuum source,
causing the semi-periodic dimming. Occultation of the central
star as well as the bright inner disk and the accretion/outflow
zones renders shocked gas in the inner part of the jet amenable
to observation at the faint epochs. We discuss PTF 10nvg as a
source exhibiting both accretion-driven (perhaps analogous to
V1647 Ori) and extinction-driven (perhaps analogous to UX Ori or
GM Cep) high-amplitude variability phenomena.},
