 abstract = {In this work, we present the first results of our imaging campaign at
Keck Observatory to identify the host galaxies of ``dark''
gamma-ray bursts (GRBs), events with no detected optical
afterglow or with detected optical flux significantly fainter
than expected from the observed X-ray afterglow. We find that
out of a uniform sample of 29 Swift bursts rapidly observed by
the Palomar 60 inch telescope through 2008 March (14 of which we
classify as dark), all events have either a detected optical
afterglow, a probable optical host-galaxy detection, or both.
Our results constrain the fraction of Swift GRBs coming from
very high redshift (z&gt;7), such as the recent GRB 090423, to
between 0.2% and 7% at 80% confidence. In contrast, a
significant fraction of the sample requires large extinction
columns (host-frame A$_V$ gsim 1 mag, with several events
showing A$_V$ &gt; 2-6 mag), identifying dust extinction as
the dominant cause of the dark GRB phenomenon. We infer that a
significant fraction of GRBs (and, by association, of high-mass
star formation) occurs in highly obscured regions. However, the
host galaxies of dark GRBs seem to have normal optical colors,
suggesting that the source of obscuring dust is local to the
vicinity of the GRB progenitor or highly unevenly distributed
within the host galaxy.},
