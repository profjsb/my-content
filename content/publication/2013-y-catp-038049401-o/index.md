abstract: "Some observations suggest that very massive stars experience extreme mass-loss episodes shortly before they explode as supernovae as do several models. Establishing a causal connection between these mass-loss episodes and the final explosion would provide a novel way to study pre-supernova massive-star evolution. Here we report observations of a mass-loss event detected 40 days before the explosion of the type IIn supernova SN 2010mc (also known as PTF 10tel). <P />(1 data file). <P />"
