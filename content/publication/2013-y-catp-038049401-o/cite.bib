 abstract = {Some observations suggest that very massive stars experience extreme
mass-loss episodes shortly before they explode as supernovae as
do several models. Establishing a causal connection between
these mass-loss episodes and the final explosion would provide a
novel way to study pre-supernova massive-star evolution. Here we
report observations of a mass-loss event detected 40 days before
the explosion of the type IIn supernova SN 2010mc (also known as
PTF 10tel). <P />(1 data file). <P />},
