 abstract = {<BR /> Aims: With this paper we want to investigate the highly variable
afterglow light curve and environment of gamma-ray burst (GRB)
060526 at z = 3.221. <BR /> Methods: We present one of the
largest photometric datasets ever obtained for a GRB afterglow,
consisting of multi-color photometric data from the ultraviolet
to the near infrared. The data set contains 412 data points in
total to which we add additional data from the literature.
Furthermore, we present low-resolution high signal-to-noise
spectra of the afterglow. The afterglow light curve is modeled
with both an analytical model using broken power law fits and
with a broad-band numerical model which includes energy
injections. The absorption lines detected in the spectra are
used to derive column densities using a multi-ion single-
component curve-of-growth analysis from which we derive the
metallicity of the host of GRB 060526. <BR /> Results: The
temporal behaviour of the afterglow follows a double broken
power law with breaks at t = 0.090 \ensuremath± 0.005 and
t = 2.401 \ensuremath± 0.061 days. It shows deviations
from the smooth set of power laws that can be modeled by
additional energy injections from the central engine, although
some significant microvariability remains. The broadband
spectral-energy distribution of the afterglow shows no
significant extinction along the line of sight. The metallicity
derived from S ii and Fe ii of [S/H] = -0.57 \ensuremath±
0.25 and [Fe/H] = -1.09 \ensuremath± 0.24 is relatively
high for a galaxy at that redshift but comparable to the
metallicity of other GRB hosts at similar redshifts. At the
position of the afterglow, no host is detected to F775W(AB) =
28.5 mag with the HST, implying an absolute magnitude of the
host M(1500 ̊A) &gt; -18.3 mag which is fainter than most
long-duration hosts, although the GRB may be associated with a
faint galaxy at a distance of 11 kpc. <P />Based in part on

Very Large Telescope under proposals 077.D-0661 (PI: Vreeswijk)
and 177.A-0591 (PI: Hjorth), as well as observations obtained
with the NASA/ESA Hubble Space Telescope under proposal 11734
