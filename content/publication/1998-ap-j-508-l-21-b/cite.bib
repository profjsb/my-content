 abstract = {We report on the discovery of the radio, infrared, and optical transient
coincident with an X-ray transient proposed to be the afterglow
of GRB 980703. At later times when the transient has faded below
detection, we see an underlying galaxy with R=22.6; this galaxy
is the brightest host galaxy (by nearly 2 mag) of any
cosmological gamma-ray burst (GRB) thus far. In keeping with an
established trend, the GRB is not significantly offset from the
host galaxy. Interpreting the multiwavelength data in the
framework of the popular fireball model requires that the
synchrotron cooling break was between the optical and X-ray
bands on 1998 July 8.5 UT and that the intrinsic extinction of
the transient is A$_V$=0.9. This is somewhat higher than the
extinction for the galaxy as a whole, as estimated from
spectroscopy.},
