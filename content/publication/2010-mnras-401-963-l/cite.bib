 abstract = {We present the discovery of an absorption-line redshift of z = 2.609 for
GRB090426, establishing the first firm lower limit to a redshift
for a gamma-ray burst (GRB) with an observed duration of
&lt;2s. With a rest-frame burst duration of T$_90z$ = 0.35s
and a detailed examination of the peak energy of the event, we
suggest that this is likely (at &gt;90 per cent confidence) a
member of the short/hard phenomenological class of GRBs. From
analysis of the optical-afterglow spectrum we find that the
burst originated along a very low HI column density sightline,
with N$_HI$ &lt; 3.2 × 10$^19$cm$^-2$. Our
GRB090426 afterglow spectrum also appears to have weaker low-
ionization absorption (SiII, CII) than
åisebox-0.5ex~95 per cent of previous
afterglow spectra. Finally, we also report the discovery of a
blue, very luminous, star-forming putative host galaxy
(\i̊sebox-0.5ex~2L$_*$) at a small angular
offset from the location of the optical afterglow. We consider
the implications of this unique GRB in the context of burst
duration classification and our understanding of GRB progenitor
scenarios.},
