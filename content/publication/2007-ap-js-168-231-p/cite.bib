 abstract = {We present optical echelle spectra of four gamma-ray burst (GRB)
afterglows (GRB 050730, GRB 050820, GRB 051111, and GRB 060418)
discovered during the first 1.5 yr of operation of the Swift
satellite and localized by either the Swift telescope or follow-
up ground-based imaging. We analyze the spectra to derive
accurate column density measurements for the transitions arising
in the interstellar medium (ISM) of the GRB host galaxies. These
measurements can be used to constrain the physical properties of
the ISM, including the metallicity, dust-to-gas ratio,
ionization state, and chemical abundances of the gas. We also
present measurements of the strong Mg II systems in the GRB
afterglow spectra. With the publication of this paper, we
provide the first data release of echelle afterglow spectra by
the GRAASP collaboration to the general community.},
