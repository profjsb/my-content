 abstract = {Thelast four years have seen a revolution in the field of gamma-ray
burst astronomy. With the detection of long-lived counterparts
in the X-ray, optical, and radio bands, we have now firmly
established the distance scale to these explosive events, we
have a basic physical understanding of the afterglow emission,
and it is generally believed that GRBs signal the formation of a
black hole. Observational evidence is emerging that the
progenitors of long-duration events are massive stars, however
this is yet to be firmly established. A number of observational
techniques hold great promise for the near future, and it is
likely that within the next decade we will understand the
properties of both the GRB sources and their environments. This
review concentrates on our understanding of the progenitors, and
those observational techniques best-suited to make progress on
this question. This review, accompanying a talk given by SRK at
the 2000 Nishinomiya conference, has two biases: it emphasizes
the unique contributions of radio afterglow measurements, and it
details in particular the work of the Caltech-NRAO-CARA GRB
collaboration. <P />},
