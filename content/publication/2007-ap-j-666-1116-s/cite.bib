 abstract = {We report the discovery and early observations of the peculiar Type IIn
supernova (SN) 2006gy in NGC 1260. With a peak visual magnitude
of about -22, it is the most luminous supernova ever recorded.
Its very slow rise to maximum took
åisebox-0.5ex~70 days, and it stayed brighter
than -21 mag for about 100 days. It is not yet clear what powers
the enormous luminosity and the total radiated energy of
\i̊sebox-0.5ex~10$^51$ erg, but we argue
that any known mechanism-thermal emission, circumstellar
interaction, or $^56$Ni decay-requires a very massive
progenitor star. The circumstellar interaction hypothesis would
require truly exceptional conditions around the star, which, in
the decades before its death, must have experienced a luminous
blue variable (LBV) eruption like the 19th century eruption of
\ensuremathη Carinae. However, this scenario fails to
explain the weak and unabsorbed soft X-rays detected by Chandra.
Radioactive decay of $^56$Ni may be a less objectionable
hypothesis, but it would imply a large Ni mass of
\rs̊ebox-0.5ex~22 M$_solar$, requiring SN
2006gy to have been a pair-instability supernova where the
star's core was obliterated. While this is still uncertain, SN
2006gy is the first supernova for which we have good reason to
suspect a pair-instability explosion. Based on a number of lines
of evidence, we eliminate the hypothesis that SN 2006gy was a
``Type IIa'' event, that is, a white dwarf exploding inside a
hydrogen envelope. Instead, we propose that the progenitor was a
very massive evolved object like \ensuremathη Carinae
that, contrary to expectations, failed to shed its hydrogen
envelope. SN 2006gy implies that some of the most massive stars
can explode prematurely during the LBV phase, never becoming
Wolf-Rayet stars. SN 2006gy also suggests that they can create
brilliant supernovae instead of experiencing ignominious deaths
through direct collapse to a black hole. If such a fate is
common among the most massive stars, then observable supernovae
from Population III stars in the early universe will be more
numerous than previously believed.},
