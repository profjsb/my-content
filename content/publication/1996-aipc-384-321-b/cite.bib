 abstract = {Recent analysis of relativistically expanding shells of cosmological
\ensuremathγ-ray bursts has shown that if the bursts
are cosmological, then most likely total energy (E$_0$) is
standard and not peak luminosity (L$_0$). Assuming a flat
Friedmann cosmology (q$_0$=1/2, \ensuremathłambda=0) and
constant rate density (\ensuremathh̊o$_0$) of bursting
sources, we fit a standard candle energy to a uniformly selected
log N-log S in the BATSE 3B catalog correcting for fluence
efficiency and averaging over 48 observed spectral shapes. We
find the data consistent with
E$_0$=7.3$_-1.0$$^+0.7$×10$^51$ ergs and
discuss implications of this energy for cosmological models of
\ensuremathγ-ray bursts. <P />},
