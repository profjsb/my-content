 abstract = {We present a group of 3740 previously identified RR Lyrae variables well
observed with the Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE). We
explore how the shape of the generic RR Lyrae mid-infrared light
curve varies over period-space, comparing light curves in mid-
infrared and optical bands. We find that optical light curves
exhibit high amplitudes and a large spectrum of light-curve
shapes, while mid-infrared light curves have low amplitudes and
uniform light-curve shapes. From the period-space analysis, we
hope to improve the classification methods of RR Lyrae variables
and enable reliable discovery of these pulsators in the WISE
catalogue and future mid-infrared surveys such as the James Webb
Space Telescope. We provide mid-infrared templates for typical
RR Lyrae stars and demonstrate how these templates can be
applied to improve estimates of mid-infrared RR Lyrae mean
magnitude, which is used for distance measurement. This method
of template fitting is particularly beneficial for improving
observational efficiency. For example, using light curves with
observational noise of 0.05 mag, we obtain the same level of
accuracy in mean magnitude estimates for light curves randomly
sampled at 12 data points with template fitting as with light
curves randomly sampled at 20 data points with harmonic
modelling.},
