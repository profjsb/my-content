 abstract = {The known host galaxies of short-hard gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) to date
are characterized by low to moderate star formation rates (SFRs)
and a broad range of stellar masses, in general agreement with
models associating the phenomenon with an old progenitor, such
as merging neutron stars. In this paper, we positionally
associate the recent unambiguously short-hard Swift GRB 100206A
with a disk galaxy at redshift z = 0.4068 that is rapidly
forming stars at a rate of åisebox-0.5ex~30 M
$_☉$ yr$^-1$, almost an order of magnitude higher than any
previously identified short-GRB host. The galaxy is very red (g
- K = 4.3 AB mag), heavily obscured (A$_V$
\ensuremath≈ 2 mag), and has the highest metallicity
of any GRB host to date (12 + log[O/H]$_KD02$ = 9.2): it is a
classical luminous infrared galaxy (LIRG), with L $_IR$
\ensuremath≈ 4 × 10$^11$ L $_☉$.
While these properties could be interpreted to support an
association of this GRB with recent star formation, modeling of
the broadband spectral energy distribution also indicates that a
substantial stellar mass of mostly older stars is also present.
The specific SFR is modest (sSFR \ensuremath≈ 0.5
Gyr$^-1$), the current SFR is not substantially elevated above
its long-term average, and the host morphology shows no sign of
recent merger activity. Our observations are therefore equally
consistent with an older progenitor. Given the precedent
established by previous short-GRB hosts and the significant
fraction of the universe's stellar mass in LIRG-like systems at
z &gt;\i̊sebox-0.5ex~ 0.3, an older progenitor
represents the most likely origin of this event.},
