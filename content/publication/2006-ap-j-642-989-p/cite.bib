 abstract = {The rapid succession of discoveries of short-duration hard-spectrum
gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) has led to unprecedented insights into
the energetics of the explosion and nature of the progenitors.
Yet short of the detection of a smoking gun, such as a burst of
coincident gravitational radiation or a Li-Paczy\ŉski
minisupernova, it is unlikely that a definitive claim can be
made for the progenitors. As was the case with long-duration
soft-spectrum GRBs, however, the expectation is that a
systematic study of the hosts and locations of short GRBs could
begin to yield fundamental clues as to their nature. We present
an aggregate study of the host galaxies of short-duration hard-
spectrum GRBs. In particular, we present the Gemini-North and
Keck discovery spectra of the galaxies that hosted three short
GRBs and a moderate-resolution
(Råisebox-0.5ex~6000) spectrum of a fourth
host. We find that these short-hard GRBs originate in a variety
of low-redshift (z&lt;1) environments that differ substantially
from those of long-soft GRBs, both on individual galaxy scales
and on galaxy-cluster scales. Specifically, three of the bursts
are found to be associated with old and massive galaxies with no
current (&lt;0.1 M$_solar$ yr$^-1$) or recent star
formation. Two of these galaxies are located within a cluster
environment. These observations support an origin from the
merger of compact stellar remnants, such as double neutron stars
or a neutron star-black hole binary. The fourth event, in
contrast, occurred within a dwarf galaxy with a star formation
rate exceeding 0.3 M$_solar$ yr$^-1$. Therefore, it appears
that like supernovae of Type Ia, the progenitors of short-hard
bursts are created in all galaxy types, suggesting a
corresponding class with a wide distribution of delay times
between formation and explosion.},
