 abstract = {The fluences of gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) are measured with a variety of
instruments in different detector energy ranges. A detailed
comparison of the implied energy releases of the GRB sample
requires then an accurate accounting of this diversity in
fluence measurements that properly corrects for the redshifting
of GRB spectra. Here we develop a methodology to ``k-correct``
the implied prompt energy release of a GRB to a fixed comoving
bandpass. This allows us to homogenize the prompt energy release
of 17 cosmological GRBs (using published redshifts, fluences,
and spectra) to two common comoving bandpasses: 20-2000 keV and
0.1 keV-10 MeV (``bolometric''). While the overall distribution
of GRB energy releases does not change significantly by using a
k-correction, we show that uncorrected energy estimates
systematically undercount the bolometric energy by
åisebox-0.5ex~5% to 600%, depending on the
particular GRB. We find that the median bolometric isotropic
equivalent prompt energy release is 2.19×10$^53$
ergs, with an rms scatter of 0.80 dex. The typical estimated
uncertainty on a given k-corrected energy measurement is
\i̊sebox-0.5ex~20%.},
