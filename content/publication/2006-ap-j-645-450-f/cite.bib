 abstract = {The bright GRB 050408 was localized by HETE-2 near local midnight in the
Western Hemisphere, enabling an impressive ground-based follow-
up effort, as well as space-based follow-up from Swift. The
Swift data from the XRT and our own optical photometry and
spectrum of the afterglow provide the cornerstone for our
analysis. Under the traditional assumption that the visible wave
band was above the peak synchrotron frequency and below the
cooling frequency, the optical photometry of 0.03-5.03 days
shows an afterglow decay corresponding to an electron energy
index of p$_lc$=2.05+/-0.04, without a jet break as suggested
by others. A break is seen in the X-ray data at early times (at
åisebox-0.5ex~12,600 s after the GRB). The
spectral slope of the optical spectrum is consistent with
p$_lc$ assuming a host galaxy extinction of A$_V$=1.18 mag.
The optical-NIR broadband spectrum is also consistent with
p=2.05 but prefers A$_V$=0.57 mag. The X-ray afterglow shows a
break at 1.26×10$^4$ s, which may be the result
of a refreshed shock. This burst stands out in that the optical
and X-ray data suggest a large H I column density of
N$_HI$\i̊sebox-0.5ex~10$^22$ cm$^-2$;
it is very likely a damped Ly\ensuremathα system, so
the faintness of the host galaxy (M$_V$&gt;-18 mag) is
noteworthy. Moreover, we detect extraordinarily strong Ti II
absorption lines with a column density through the GRB host that
exceeds the largest values observed for the Milky Way by 1 order
of magnitude. Furthermore, the Ti II equivalent width is in the
top 1% of Mg II absorption-selected QSOs. This suggests that
the large-scale environment of GRB 050408 has significantly
lower Ti depletion than our Galaxy and a large velocity width
(\ensuremathδv&gt;150 km s$^-1$).},
