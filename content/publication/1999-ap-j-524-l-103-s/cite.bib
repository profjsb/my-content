 abstract = {The optical transient of the faint gamma-ray burst GRB 990308 was
detected by the QUEST camera on the Venezuelan 1 m Schmidt
telescope starting 3.28 hr after the burst. Our photometry gives
V=18.32+/-0.07, R=18.14+/-0.06, B=18.65+/-0.23, and
R=18.22+/-0.05 for times ranging from 3.28 to 3.47 hr after the
burst. The colors correspond to a spectral slope of close to f$_
\ensuremathν$åisebox-0.5ex~\ensuremat
hν$^1/3$. Within the standard synchrotron fireball model,
this requires that the external medium be less dense than
10$^4$ cm$^-3$, the electrons contain more than 20% of
the shock energy, and the magnetic field energy be less than
24% of the energy in the electrons for normal interstellar or
circumstellar densities. We also report upper limits of
V&gt;12.0 at 132 s (with LOTIS), V&gt;13.4 from 132 to 1029 s
(with LOTIS), V&gt;15.3 at 28.2 minutes (with Super-LOTIS), and
a 8.5 GHz flux of less than 114 \ensuremathμJy at 110 days
(with the Very Large Array). Wisconsin-Indiana-Yale-NOAO 3.5 m
and Keck 10 m telescopes reveal this location to be empty of any
host galaxy to R&gt;25.7 and K&gt;23.3. The lack of a host
galaxy likely implies that it is either substantially
subluminous or more distant than a redshift of
\i̊sebox-0.5ex~1.2.},
