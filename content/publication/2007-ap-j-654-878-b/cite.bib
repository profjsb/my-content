 abstract = {Starting with the first detection of an afterglow from a short-duration
hard-spectrum \ensuremathγ-ray burst (SHB) by Swift
last year, a growing body of evidence has suggested that SHBs
are associated with an older and lower redshift galactic
population than long-soft GRBs and, in a few cases, with large
(&gt;åisebox-0.5ex~10 kpc) projected offsets
from the centers of their putative host galaxies. Here we
present observations of the field of GRB 060502B, a SHB detected
by Swift and localized by the X-Ray Telescope (XRT). We find a
massive red galaxy at a redshift of z=0.287 at an angular
distance of 17.1$^″$ from our revised XRT position. Using
associative and probabilistic arguments, we suggest that this
galaxy hosted the progenitor of GRB 060502B. If true, this
offset would correspond to a physical displacement of 73+/-19
kpc in projection, about twice the largest offset inferred for
any SHB to date and almost an order of magnitude larger than a
typical long-soft burst offset. Spectra and modeling of the star
formation history of this possible host show it to have
undergone a large ancient starburst. If the progenitor of GRB
060502B was formed in this starburst episode, the time of the
GRB explosion since birth is
\ensuremathτ\i̊sebox-0.5ex~1.3+/-0.2 Gyr
and the minimum kick velocity of the SHB progenitor is
v$_kick,min$=55+/-15 km s$^-1$.},
