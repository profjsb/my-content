Technology, report on behalf of the Caltech-NRAO-CARA GRB
Collaboration: ``On Jan. 23.56 UT, we imaged the BeppoSAX
localization (Piro et al. 1999, GCN 199,
http://gcn.gsfc.nasa.gov/gcn/gcn3/199.gcn3) of GRB 990123 with
the Palomar 1.52-m reflector (+ CCD). We found a source (R =
18.2) located at R.A. = 15h25m30s.5, Decl. = +44o46'00''
(equinox 2000.0; GCN 202 gives a revised BeppoSAX position of
R.A. = 15h25m29s, Decl. = +44o45'.5). The error in the position
(derived from the Digital Sky Survey) is about 1``.5. At the
same location, no object is detected to the plate limit of the
first Palomar Sky Survey, whereas a faint (R about 21.3) object
is seen in the second Palomar Sky Survey image. The photometry
is preliminary and is based on the Cambridge Automated Plate
Machine catalogue. Finding charts can be found at http://astro.c

l; see also GCN 201. We suggest that the bright object is the
optical afterglow of GRB 990123 and that the faint object is the
host galaxy. If so, this is the brightest optical afterglow and
host galaxy known to date. In view of this, we urge observations
at all wavelengths and particularly spectroscopic observations
of this object.'' <P />},
