 abstract = {We investigate the relationship between stellar and gas specific angular
momentum j, stellar mass M$_*$ and optical morphology for a
sample of 488 galaxies extracted from the Sydney-AAO Multi-
object Integral field Galaxy Survey. We find that j, measured
within one effective radius, monotonically increases with
M$_*$ and that, for M$_*$ &gt; 10$^9.5$ M$_☉$, the
scatter in this relation strongly correlates with optical
morphology (I.e. visual classification and Sérsic index).
These findings confirm that massive galaxies of all types lie on
a plane relating mass, angular momentum and stellar-light
distribution, and suggest that the large-scale morphology of a
galaxy is regulated by its mass and dynamical state. We show
that the significant scatter in the M$_*$-j relation is
accounted for by the fact that, at fixed stellar mass, the
contribution of ordered motions to the dynamical support of
galaxies varies by at least a factor of 3. Indeed, the stellar
spin parameter (quantified via \ensuremathłambda$_R$)
correlates strongly with Sérsic and concentration indices.
This correlation is particularly strong once slow rotators are
removed from the sample, showing that late-type galaxies and
early-type fast rotators form a continuous class of objects in
terms of their kinematic properties.},
