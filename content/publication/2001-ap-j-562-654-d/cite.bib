 abstract = {GRB 970828 was the first well-localized \ensuremathγ-ray burst
(GRB) X-ray afterglow for which no optical afterglow was found
despite a prompt, deep search down to
R$_lim$åisebox-0.5ex~24.5 mag. We report the
discovery of a short-lived radio flare within the X-ray
localization error circle of this burst. Such radio flares are
seen in about 25% of GRB afterglows, and their origin is not
well understood. The precise radio position enabled us to
identify the likely host galaxy of this burst and to measure its
redshift, z=0.9578. The host appears to be an
interacting/merging system. Under the assumption that the X-ray
afterglow is mainly due to synchrotron mechanism, we infer the
optical afterglow flux. The observed upper limits to the optical
flux are easily explained by invoking an intervening dusty cloud
within the host galaxy. These observations support the idea that
GRBs with no detectable optical afterglows, or ``dark GRBs,''
can be due to dust extinction within the host galaxies. The
census of dark GRBs can then be used to constrain the fraction
of the obscured star formation in the universe. We argue that
the existing data already indicate that the obscured star
formation rate is no more than one-half of that seen at UV and
optical wavelengths. Partially based on the observations
obtained at the W. M. Keck Observatory, which is operated by the
California Association for Research in Astronomy, a scientific
partnership among California Institute of Technology, the
University of California, and the National Aeronautics and Space
Administration.},
