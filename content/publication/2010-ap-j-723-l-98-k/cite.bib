 abstract = {We present the discovery, photometric, and spectroscopic follow-up
observations of SN 2010X (PTF 10bhp). This supernova decays
exponentially with \ensuremathτ$_ d $ = 5 days and
rivals the current recordholder in speed, SN 2002bj. SN 2010X
peaks at M $_ r $ = -17 mag and has mean velocities of 10,000
km s$^-1$. Our light curve modeling suggests a radioactivity-
powered event and an ejecta mass of 0.16 M $_sun$. If powered
by Nickel, we show that the Nickel mass must be very small
(\ensuremath≈0.02 M $_sun$) and that the supernova
quickly becomes optically thin to \ensuremathγ-rays.
Our spectral modeling suggests that SN 2010X and SN 2002bj have
similar chemical compositions and that one of aluminum or helium
is present. If aluminum is present, we speculate that this may
be an accretion-induced collapse of an O-Ne-Mg white dwarf. If
helium is present, all observables of SN 2010X are consistent
with being a thermonuclear helium shell detonation on a white
dwarf, a ``.Ia'' explosion. With the 1 day dynamic-cadence
experiment on the Palomar Transient Factory, we expect to
annually discover a few such events.},
