 abstract = {The third observing run by LVC has brought the discovery of many compact
binary coalescences. Following the detection of the first binary
neutron star merger in this run (LIGO/Virgo S190425z), we
performed a dedicated follow-up campaign with the Zwicky
Transient Facility (ZTF) and Palomar Gattini-IR telescopes. The
initial skymap of this single-detector gravitational wave (GW)
trigger spanned most of the sky observable from Palomar
Observatory. Covering 8000 deg$^2$ of the initial skymap over
the next two nights, corresponding to 46% integrated
probability, ZTF system achieved a depth of
\ensuremath≈21 m $_AB$ in g- and r-bands. Palomar
Gattini-IR covered 2200 square degrees in J-band to a depth of
15.5 mag, including 32% integrated probability based on the
initial skymap. The revised skymap issued the following day
reduced these numbers to 21% for the ZTF and 19% for Palomar
Gattini-IR. We narrowed 338,646 ZTF transient
“alerts” over the first two
nights of observations to 15 candidate counterparts. Two
candidates, ZTF19aarykkb and ZTF19aarzaod, were particularly
compelling given that their location, distance, and age were
consistent with the GW event, and their early optical light
curves were photometrically consistent with that of kilonovae.
These two candidates were spectroscopically classified as young
core-collapse supernovae. The remaining candidates were ruled
out as supernovae. Palomar Gattini-IR did not identify any
viable candidates with multiple detections only after merger
time. We demonstrate that even with single-detector GW events
localized to thousands of square degrees, systematic kilonova
discovery is feasible.},
