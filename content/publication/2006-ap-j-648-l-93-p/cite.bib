 abstract = {We report on a survey for strong (rest equivalent width W$_r$&gt;=1
̊A), intervening Mg II systems along the sight lines to
long-duration gamma-ray bursts (GRBs). The GRB spectra that
comprise the survey have a heterogeneous mix of resolution and
wavelength coverage, but we implement a strict, uniform set of
search criteria to derive a well-defined statistical sample. We
identify 14 strong Mg II absorbers along 14 GRB sight lines
(nearly every sight line exhibits at least one absorber) with
spectra covering a total path length \ensuremathΔz=15.5
at a mean redshift z̄=1.1. In contrast, the predicted incidence
of such absorber systems along the same path length to quasar
sight lines is only 3.8. The roughly 4 times higher incidence
along GRB sight lines is inconsistent with a statistical
fluctuation at greater than 99.9% c.l. Several effects could
explain the result: (1) dust within the Mg II absorbers obscures
faint quasars giving a lower observed incidence along quasar
sight lines, (2) the gas is intrinsic to the GRB event, and (3)
the GRBs are gravitationally lensed by these absorbers. We
present strong arguments against the first two effects and also
consider lensing to be an unlikely explanation. The results
suggest that at least one of our fundamental assumptions
underpinning extragalactic absorption line research is flawed.},
