 abstract = {We present the discovery and extensive early-time observations of the
Type Ic supernova (SN) PTF12gzk. Our light curves show a rise of
0.8 mag within 2.5 hr. Power-law fits (f(t)vprop(t - t
$_0$)$^ n $) to these data constrain the explosion date to
within one day. We cannot rule out a quadratic fireball model,
but higher values of n are possible as well for larger areas in
the fit parameter space. Our bolometric light curve and a dense
spectral sequence are used to estimate the physical parameters
of the exploding star and of the explosion. We show that the
photometric evolution of PTF12gzk is slower than that of most
SNe Ic. The high ejecta expansion velocities we measure
(åisebox-0.5ex~30, 000 km s$^-1$ derived
from line minima four days after explosion) are similar to the
observed velocities of broad-lined SNe Ic associated with gamma-
ray bursts (GRBs) rather than to normal SN Ic velocities. Yet,
this SN does not show the persistent broad lines that are
typical of broad-lined SNe Ic. The host-galaxy characteristics
are also consistent with GRB-SN hosts, and not with normal SN Ic
hosts. By comparison with the spectroscopically similar SN
2004aw, we suggest that the observed properties of PTF12gzk
indicate an initial progenitor mass of 25-35 M $_☉$ and a
large ((5-10) × 10$^51$ erg) kinetic energy, the
later being close to the regime of GRB-SN properties.},
