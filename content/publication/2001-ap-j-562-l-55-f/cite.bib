 abstract = {We present a comprehensive sample of all gamma-ray burst (GRB)
afterglows with known distances, and we derive their conical
opening angles based on observed broadband breaks in their light
curves. Within the framework of this conical jet model, we
correct for the geometry and we find that the gamma-ray energy
release is narrowly clustered around 5Ã—10$^50$
ergs. We draw three conclusions. First, the central engines of
GRBs release energies that are comparable to ordinary
supernovae. Second, the broad distribution in fluence and
luminosity for GRBs is largely the result of a wide variation of
opening angles. Third, only a small fraction of GRBs are visible
to a given observer, and the true GRB rate is several hundred
times larger than the observed rate.},
