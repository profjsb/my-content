 abstract = {Of the cosmological gamma-ray bursts, GRB 011121 has the lowest
redshift, z=0.36. More importantly, the multicolor excess in the
afterglow detected in the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) light
curves is compelling observational evidence of an underlying
supernova. Here we present near-infrared and radio observations
of the afterglow, and from our comprehensive afterglow modeling,
we find evidence favoring a wind-fed circumburst medium. Lacking
X-ray data, we are unable to conclusively measure the mass-loss
rate, M, but obtain an estimate,
Måisebox-0.5ex~2×10$^-7$/v$_w3$
M$_solar$ yr$^-1$, where v$_w3$ is the speed of the wind
from the progenitor in units of 10$^3$ km s$^-1$. This M
is similar to that inferred for the progenitor of the Type Ibc
supernova SN 1998bw that has been associated with the peculiar
burst GRB 980425. Our data, taken in conjunction with the HST
results of Bloom et al., provide a consistent picture: the long-
duration GRB 011121 had a massive star progenitor that exploded
as a supernova at about the same time as the gamma-ray burst
event. Finally, we note that the gamma-ray profile of GRB 011121
is similar to that of GRB 980425.},
