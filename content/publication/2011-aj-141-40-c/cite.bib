 abstract = {During a synoptic survey of the North American Nebula region, the
Palomar Transient Factory (PTF) detected an optical outburst
(dubbed PTF10nvg) associated with the previously unstudied flat
or rising spectrum infrared source IRAS 20496+4354. The PTF
R-band light curve reveals that PTF10nvg brightened by more than
5 mag during the current outburst, rising to a peak magnitude of
R $_PTF$ \ensuremath≈ 13.5 in 2010 September.
Follow-up observations indicate that PTF10nvg has undergone a
similar åisebox-0.5ex~5 mag brightening in the
K band and possesses a rich emission-line spectrum, including
numerous lines commonly assumed to trace mass accretion and
outflows. Many of these lines are blueshifted by
\i̊sebox-0.5ex~175 km s$^-1$ from the North
American Nebula's rest velocity, suggesting that PTF10nvg is
driving an outflow. Optical spectra of PTF10nvg show several
TiO/VO band heads fully in emission, indicating the presence of
an unusual amount of dense (&gt;10$^10$ cm$^-3$), warm
(1500-4000 K) circumstellar material. Near-infrared spectra of
PTF10nvg appear quite similar to a spectrum of McNeil's
Nebula/V1647 Ori, a young star which has undergone several
brightenings in recent decades, and 06297+1021W, a Class I
protostar with a similarly reached near-infrared emission line
spectrum. While further monitoring is required to fully
understand this event, we conclude that the brightening of
PTF10nvg is indicative of enhanced accretion and outflow in this
Class-I-type protostellar object, similar to the behavior of
V1647 Ori in 2004-2005.},
