 abstract = {We report the discovery by the Swift hard X-ray monitor of the transient
source Swift J2058.4+0516 (Sw J2058+05). Our multi-wavelength
follow-up campaign uncovered a long-lived (duration
&gt;åisebox-0.5ex~ months), luminous X-ray (L
$_X, iso$ \ensuremath≈ 3 × 10$^47$
erg s$^-1$) and radio (\ensuremathνL
$_\ensuremathν, iso$ \ensuremath≈ 10$^42$
erg s$^-1$) counterpart. The associated optical emission,
however, from which we measure a redshift of 1.1853, is
relatively faint, and this is not due to a large amount of dust
extinction in the host galaxy. Based on numerous similarities
with the recently discovered GRB 110328A/Swift J164449.3+573451
(Sw J1644+57), we suggest that Sw J2058+05 may be the second
member of a new class of relativistic outbursts resulting from
the tidal disruption of a star by a supermassive black hole. If
so, the relative rarity of these sources (compared with the
expected rate of tidal disruptions) implies that either these
outflows are extremely narrowly collimated
(\ensuremathþeta &lt; 1°) or only a small
fraction of tidal disruptions generate relativistic ejecta.
Analogous to the case of long-duration gamma-ray bursts and
core-collapse supernovae, we speculate that rapid spin of the
black hole may be a necessary condition to generate the
relativistic component. Alternatively, if powered by gas
accretion (i.e., an active galactic nucleus (AGN)), Sw J2058+05
would seem to represent a new mode of variability in these
sources, as the observed properties appear largely inconsistent
with known classes of AGNs capable of generating relativistic
jets (blazars, narrow-line Seyfert 1 galaxies).},
