 abstract = {We present optical light curves of 29 novae in M31 during the 2009 and
2010 observing seasons of the Palomar Transient Factory (PTF).
The dynamic and rapid cadences in PTF monitoring of M31, from
one day to ten minutes, provide excellent temporal coverage of
nova light curves, enabling us to record the photometric
evolution of M31 novae in unprecedented detail. We also detect
eight of these novae in the near-ultraviolet (UV) band with the
Galaxy Evolution Explorer (GALEX) satellite. Novae M31N 2009-10b
and M31N 2010-11a show prominent UV emission peaking a few days
prior to their optical maxima, possibly implying aspherical
outbursts. Additionally, our blueshifted spectrum of the recent
outburst of PT And (M31N 2010-12a) indicates that it is a
recurrent nova in M31 and not a dwarf nova in the Milky Way as
was previously assumed. Finally, we systematically searched for
novae in all confirmed globular clusters (GCs) of M31 and found
only M31N 2010-10f associated with Bol 126. The specific nova
rate in the M31 GC system is thus about one per year, which is
not enhanced relative to the rate outside the GC system.},
