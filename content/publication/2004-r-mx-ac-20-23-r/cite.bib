 abstract = {We present here the results of a search for new microquasars at low
galactic latitudes, based on a cross-identification between the
ROSAT all sky Bright Source Catalog (RBSC) and the NRAO VLA Sky
Survey (NVSS) and follow-up observations. The results obtained
up to now suggest that persistent/silent microquasars such as LS
5039 are rare objects in our Galaxy, and indicate that future
deeper surveys, and harder than the RBSC in X-rays, will play a
fundamental role in order to discover them.},
