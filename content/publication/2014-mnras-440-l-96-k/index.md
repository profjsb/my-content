abstract: "We use photometry from the recent AllWISE Data Release of the Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE) of 129 calibration stars, combined with prior distances obtained from the established M$_V$-[Fe/H] relation and Hubble Space Telescope trigonometric parallax, to derive mid-infrared period-luminosity relations for RR Lyrae pulsating variable stars. We derive relations in the W1, W2 and W3 wavebands (3.4, 4.6 and 12 Î¼m, respectively), and for each of the two main RR Lyrae sub-types (RRab and RRc). We report an error on the period-luminosity relation slope for RRab stars of 0.2. We also fit posterior distances for the calibration catalogue and find a median fractional distance error of 0.8 per cent. L111"
