 abstract = {We use photometry from the recent AllWISE Data Release of the Wide-field
Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE) of 129 calibration stars,
combined with prior distances obtained from the established
M$_V$-[Fe/H] relation and Hubble Space Telescope trigonometric
parallax, to derive mid-infrared period-luminosity relations for
RR Lyrae pulsating variable stars. We derive relations in the
W1, W2 and W3 wavebands (3.4, 4.6 and 12 \ensuremathÎ¼m,
respectively), and for each of the two main RR Lyrae sub-types
(RRab and RRc). We report an error on the period-luminosity
relation slope for RRab stars of 0.2. We also fit posterior
distances for the calibration catalogue and find a median
fractional distance error of 0.8 per cent. L111},
