 abstract = {The Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM) triggers on-board in response to
åisebox-0.5ex~40 short gamma-ray bursts
(SGRBs) per year; however, their large localization regions have
made the search for optical counterparts a challenging
endeavour. We have developed and executed an extensive program
with the wide field of view of the Zwicky Transient Facility
(ZTF) camera, mounted on the Palomar 48 inch Oschin telescope
(P48), to perform target-of-opportunity (ToO) observations on 10
Fermi-GBM SGRBs during 2018 and 2020-2021. Bridging the large
sky areas with small field-of-view optical telescopes in order
to track the evolution of potential candidates, we look for the
elusive SGRB afterglows and kilonovae (KNe) associated with
these high-energy events. No counterpart has yet been found,
even though more than 10 ground-based telescopes, part of the
Global Relay of Observatories Watching Transients Happen
(GROWTH) network, have taken part in these efforts. The
candidate selection procedure and the follow-up strategy have
shown that ZTF is an efficient instrument for searching for
poorly localized SGRBs, retrieving a reasonable number of
candidates to follow up and showing promising capabilities as
the community approaches the multi-messenger era. Based on the
median limiting magnitude of ZTF, our searches would have been
able to retrieve a GW170817-like event up to
\i̊sebox-0.5ex~200 Mpc and SGRB afterglows to z
= 0.16 or 0.4, depending on the assumed underlying energy model.
Future ToOs will expand the horizon to z = 0.2 and 0.7,
respectively.},
