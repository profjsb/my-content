abstract: The Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM) triggers on-board in response to
  åisebox-0.5ex 40 short gamma-ray bursts (SGRBs) per year; however, their large localization
  regions have made the search for optical counterparts a challenging endeavour. We
  have developed and executed an extensive program with the wide field of view of
  the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) camera, mounted on the Palomar 48 inch Oschin
  telescope (P48), to perform target-of-opportunity (ToO) observations on 10 Fermi-GBM
  SGRBs during 2018 and 2020-2021. Bridging the large sky areas with small field-of-view
  optical telescopes in order to track the evolution of potential candidates, we look
  for the elusive SGRB afterglows and kilonovae (KNe) associated with these high-energy
  events. No counterpart has yet been found, even though more than 10 ground-based
  telescopes, part of the Global Relay of Observatories Watching Transients Happen
  (GROWTH) network, have taken part in these efforts. The candidate selection procedure
  and the follow-up strategy have shown that ZTF is an efficient instrument for searching
  for poorly localized SGRBs, retrieving a reasonable number of candidates to follow
  up and showing promising capabilities as the community approaches the multi-messenger
  era. Based on the median limiting magnitude of ZTF, our searches would have been
  able to retrieve a GW170817-like event up to i̊sebox-0.5ex 200 Mpc and SGRB afterglows
  to z = 0.16 or 0.4, depending on the assumed underlying energy model. Future ToOs
  will expand the horizon to z = 0.2 and 0.7, respectively.
