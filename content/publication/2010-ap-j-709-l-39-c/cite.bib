 abstract = {The quasar SDSS J153636.22+044127.0, exhibiting peculiar broad emission-
line profiles with multiple components, was proposed as a
candidate sub-parsec binary supermassive black hole system. More
recently, imaging revealed two spatially distinct sources,
leading some to suggest that the system was a quasar pair
separated by åisebox-0.5ex~5 kpc. We present
Palomar and Keck optical spectra of this system from which we
identify a third velocity component to the emission lines. We
argue that the system is more likely an unusual member of the
class of active galactic nuclei known as ``double-peaked
emitters'' than a sub-parsec black hole binary or quasar pair.
We find no significant velocity evolution of the two main peaks
over the course of 0.95 yr, with a 3\ensuremathσ upper
limit on any secular change of 70 km s$^-1$ yr$^-1$. We also
find that the three velocity components of the emission lines
are spatially coincident to within 0farcs015 along the slit,
apparently ruling out the double-quasar hypothesis. <P />},
