 abstract = {In 2006, Prochter et al. reported a statistically significant
enhancement of very strong Mg II absorption systems intervening
the sight lines to gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) relative to the
incidence of such absorption along quasar sight lines. This
counterintuitive result has inspired a diverse set of
astrophysical explanations (e.g., dust, gravitational lensing)
but none of these has obviously resolved the puzzle. Using the
largest set of GRB afterglow spectra available, we reexamine the
purported enhancement. In an independent sample of GRB spectra
with a survey path three times larger than Prochter et al., we
measure the incidence per unit redshift of &gt;=1 ̊A rest-
frame equivalent width Mg II absorbers at z
\ensuremath≈ 1 to be l(z) = 0.18 \ensuremath±
0.06. This is fully consistent with current estimates for the
incidence of such absorbers along quasar sight lines. Therefore,
we do not confirm the original enhancement and suggest those
results suffered from a statistical fluke. Signatures of the
original result do remain in our full sample (l(z) shows an
\ensuremath≈1.5 enhancement over l(z)$_QSO$), but
the statistical significance now lies at
\ensuremath≈90% c.l. Restricting our analysis to the
subset of high-resolution spectra of GRB afterglows (which
overlaps substantially with Prochter et al.), we still reproduce
a statistically significant enhancement of Mg II absorption. The
reason for this excess, if real, is still unclear since there is
no connection between the rapid afterglow follow-up process with
echelle (or echellette) spectrographs and the detectability of
strong Mg II doublets. Only a larger sample of such high-
resolution data will shed some light on this matter.},
