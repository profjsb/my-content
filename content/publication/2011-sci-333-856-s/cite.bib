 abstract = {Type Ia supernovae are key tools for measuring distances on a cosmic
scale. They are generally thought to be the thermonuclear
explosion of an accreting white dwarf in a close binary system.
The nature of the mass donor is still uncertain. In the single-
degenerate model it is a main-sequence star or an evolved star,
whereas in the double-degenerate model it is another white
dwarf. We show that the velocity structure of absorbing material
along the line of sight to 35 type Ia supernovae tends to be
blueshifted. These structures are likely signatures of gas
outflows from the supernova progenitor systems. Thus, many type
Ia supernovae in nearby spiral galaxies may originate in single-
degenerate systems.},
