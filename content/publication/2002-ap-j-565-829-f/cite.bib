 abstract = {We present millimeter- and submillimeter-wavelength observations and
near-infrared K-band imaging toward the bright gamma-ray burst
GRB 010222. Over seven different epochs, a constant source was
detected with an average flux density of 3.74+/-0.53 mJy at 350
GHz and 1.05+/-0.22 mJy at 250 GHz, giving a spectral index
\ensuremathα=3.78+/-0.25 (where Fåisebox-0.5ex\text
asciitilde\ensuremathν$^\ensuremathα$). We rule
out the possibility that this emission originated from the burst
or its afterglow, and we conclude that it is due to a dusty,
high-redshift starburst galaxy (SMM J14522+4301). We argue that
the host galaxy of GRB 010222 is the most plausible counterpart
of SMM J14522+4301, based in part on the centimeter detection of
the host at the expected level. The optical/near-IR properties
of the host galaxy of GRB 010222 suggest that it is a blue
sub-L$_*$ galaxy, similar to other GRB host galaxies. This
contrasts with the enormous far-infrared luminosity of this
galaxy based on our submillimeter detection (L$_Bol$\i̊sebox
-0.5ex~4×10$^12$L$_solar$). We
suggest that this GRB host galaxy has a very high star formation
rate, SFR \rs̊ebox-0.5ex~600 M$_solar$
yr$^-1$, most of which is unseen at optical wavelengths.},
