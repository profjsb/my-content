 abstract = {Synoptic searches for the optical counterpart to a binary neutron star
(BNS) or neutron star-black hole (NSBH) merger can pose
significant challenges towards the discovery of kilonovae and
performing multi-messenger science. In this work, we describe
the advantage of a global multi-telescope network towards this
end, with a particular focus on the key and complementary role
the Dark Energy Camera (DECam) plays in multi-facility follow-
up. We describe the Global Relay of Observatories Watching
Transients Happen (GROWTH) Target-of-Opportunity (ToO) Marshal,
a common web application we built to ingest events, plan
observations, search for transient candidates, and retrieve
performance summary statistics for all of the telescopes in our
network. Our infrastructure enabled us to conduct observations
of two events during O3a, S190426c and S190510g. Furthermore,
our analysis of deep DECam observations of S190814bv conducted
by the DESGW team, and access to a variety of global follow-up
facilities allowed us to place meaningful constraints on the
parameters of the kilonova and the merging binary. We emphasize
the importance of a global telescope network in conjunction with
a power telescope like DECam in performing searches for the
counterparts to gravitational-wave sources.},
