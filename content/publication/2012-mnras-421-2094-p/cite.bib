 abstract = {The Palomar Transient Factory (PTF) is a synoptic survey designed to
explore the transient and variable sky in a wide variety of
cadences. We use PTF observations of fields that were observed
multiple times (\ensuremath\gtrsim10) per night, for several
nights, to find asteroids, construct their light curves and
measure their rotation periods. Here we describe the pipeline we
use to achieve these goals and present the results from the
first four (overlapping) PTF fields analysed as part of this
programme. These fields, which cover an area of 21 deg$^2$,
were observed on four nights with a cadence of ̃20 min. Our
pipeline was able to detect 624 asteroids, of which 145
(\ensuremath≈20 per cent) were previously unknown. We
present high-quality rotation periods for 88 main-belt asteroids
and possible period or lower limit on the period for an
additional 85 asteroids. For the remaining 451 asteroids, we
present lower limits on their photometric amplitudes. Three of
the asteroids have light curves that are characteristic of
binary asteroids. We estimate that implementing our search for
all existing high-cadence PTF data will provide rotation periods
for about 10 000 asteroids mainly in the magnitude range
\ensuremath≈14 to \ensuremath≈20. <P />},
