 abstract = {We report on observations of a gamma-ray burst (GRB 061126) with an
extremely bright (R \ensuremathâ‰ˆ 12 mag at peak)
early-time optical afterglow. The optical afterglow is already
fading as a power law 22 s after the trigger, with no detectable
prompt contribution in our first exposure, which was coincident
with a large prompt-emission gamma-ray pulse. The optical-
infrared photometric SED is an excellent fit to a power law, but
it exhibits a moderate red-to-blue evolution in the spectral
index at about 500 s after the burst. This color change is
contemporaneous with a switch from a relatively fast decay to
slower decay. The rapidly decaying early afterglow is broadly
consistent with synchrotron emission from a reverse shock, but a
bright forward-shock component predicted by the intermediate- to
late-time X-ray observations under the assumptions of standard
afterglow models is not observed. Indeed, despite its remarkable
early-time brightness, this burst would qualify as a dark burst
at later times on the basis of its nearly flat optical-to-X-ray
spectral index. Our photometric SED provides no evidence of host
galaxy extinction, requiring either large quantities of gray
dust in the host system (at redshift 1.1588 +/- 0.0006, based on
our late-time Keck spectroscopy) or separate physical origins
for the X-ray and optical afterglows.},
