 abstract = {We present a densely sampled, homogeneous set of light curves of 64 low-
redshift (z &lt;åisebox-0.5ex~ 0.05)
stripped-envelope supernovae (SNe of Type IIb, Ib, Ic, and Ic-
BL). These data were obtained between 2001 and 2009 at the Fred
L. Whipple Observatory (FLWO) on Mount Hopkins in Arizona, with
the optical FLWO 1.2 m and the near-infrared (NIR) Peters
Automated Infrared 1.3 m telescopes. Our data set consists of
4543 optical photometric measurements on 61 SNe, including a
combination of \U\!BV\!RI\,
\U\!BV\!r\̂\prime
\i\\̂prime \\, and \u\^p̂rime
\\!BV\!r\^\r̂ime
\i\^\\îme \\, and 1919 JHK$_s$ NIR
measurements on 25 SNe. This sample constitutes the most
extensive multi-color data set of stripped-envelope SNe to date.
Our photometry is based on template-subtracted images to
eliminate any potential host-galaxy light contamination. This
work presents these photometric data, compares them with data in
the literature, and estimates basic statistical quantities: date
of maximum, color, and photometric properties. We identify
promising color trends that may permit the identification of
stripped-envelope SN subtypes from their photometry alone. Many
of these SNe were observed spectroscopically by the Harvard-
Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics (CfA) SN group, and the
spectra are presented in a companion paper. A thorough
exploration that combines the CfA photometry and spectroscopy of
stripped-envelope core-collapse SNe will be presented in a
follow-up paper.},
