 abstract = {Making use of virtual observatory data, we present the first
comprehensive sample of optical observations conducted before
the explosion times of all gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) with known
redshifts. In total, the fields of 11 such GRBs were observed by
the Near-Earth Asteroid Tracking (NEAT) program from years to
hours before the bursts. Although the typical limiting
magnitudes from these observations are
Råisebox-0.5ex~20 mag, we find no evidence for
a significant detection of a precursor. The deepest nondetection
of precursor emission is from GRB 030329, reaching down to an
absolute B-band magnitude of
M$_B$\i̊sebox-0.5ex~-18 mag from 6 to 1500
days (rest frame) before the burst. This is of comparable
brightness to supernovae, which in some scenarios for GRB
progenitors are predicted to predate a GRB on similar
timescales. Since sources cannot be localized to better than
\rs̊ebox-0.5ex~500 mas (3
\ensuremathσ) with current large-area surveys,
unrelated supernovae or active galactic nucleus activity in GRB
hosts could be mistaken for genuine precursor emission. This
possibility motivates the need for not only deep wide-field
imaging, but imaging at high spatial resolution.},
