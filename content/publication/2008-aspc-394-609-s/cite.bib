 abstract = {The Transients Classification Pipeline (TCP) is a Berkeley-led project
which federates data streams from multiple surveys and
observatories, classifies with machine learning and astronomer
defined science priors, and broadcasts sources of interest to
various science clients (using the VOEvent protocol). The TCP is
a production-level project, being developed to handle several
upcoming data torrents (e.g. from the Palomar Transient
Project), and should be scalable to LSST volumes. <P />},
