 abstract = {The intermediate Palomar Transient Factory reports our discovery of a
young supernova, iPTF13bvn, in the nearby galaxy, NGC 5806 (22.5
Mpc). Our spectral sequence in the optical and infrared suggests
a Type Ib classification. We identify a blue progenitor
candidate in deep pre-explosion imaging within a
2\ensuremathσ error circle of 80 mas (8.7 pc). The
candidate has an M$_B$ luminosity of -5.52 \ensuremath±
0.39 mag and a B - I color of 0.25 \ensuremath± 0.25 mag.
If confirmed by future observations, this would be the first
direct detection for a progenitor of a Type Ib. Fitting a power
law to the early light curve, we find an extrapolated explosion
date around 0.6 days before our first detection. We see no
evidence of shock cooling. The pre-explosion detection limits
constrain the radius of the progenitor to be smaller than a few
solar radii. iPTF13bvn is also detected in centimeter and
millimeter wavelengths. Fitting a synchrotron self-absorption
model to our radio data, we find a mass-loading parameter of
1.3×10$^12$ g cm$^-1$. Assuming a wind velocity
of 10$^3$ km s$^-1$, we derive a progenitor mass-loss rate
of 3 × 10$^-5$ M $_☉$ yr$^-1$. Our
observations, taken as a whole, are consistent with a Wolf-Rayet
progenitor of the supernova iPTF13bvn.},
