abstract: We present optical and near-infrared (NIR) photometric observations of GRB
  191016 with the COATLI,DDOTI, and RATIR ground-based telescopes over the first three
  nights. We present the temporal evolution of the optical afterglow and describe
  five different stages that were not completely characterized in previous works,
  mainly due to scarcity of data points to accurately fit the different components
  of the optical emission. After the end of the prompt gamma-ray emission, we observed
  the afterglow rise slowly in the optical and NIR wavelengths and peak at around
  T + 1450 s in all filters. This was followed by an early decay, a clear plateau
  from T + 5000 s to T + 11 000 s, and then a regular late decay. We also present
  evidence of the jet break at later times, with a temporal index in good agreement
  with the temporal slope obtained from X-ray observations. Although many of the features
  observed in the optical light curves of gamma- ray bursts are usually well explained
  by a reverse shock (RS) or forward shock (FS), the shallowness of the optical rise
  and enhanced peak emission in the GRB 191016A afterglow is not well fitted by only
  a FS or a RS. We propose a theoretical model which considers both of these components
  and combines an evolving FS with a later embedded RS and a subsequent late energy
  injection from the central engine activity. We use this model to successfully explain
  the temporal evolution of the light curves and discuss its implications on the fireball
  properties.
