 abstract = {We present optical and near-infrared (NIR) photometric observations of
GRB 191016 with the COATLI,DDOTI, and RATIR ground-based
telescopes over the first three nights. We present the temporal
evolution of the optical afterglow and describe five different
stages that were not completely characterized in previous works,
mainly due to scarcity of data points to accurately fit the
different components of the optical emission. After the end of
the prompt gamma-ray emission, we observed the afterglow rise
slowly in the optical and NIR wavelengths and peak at around T +
1450 s in all filters. This was followed by an early decay, a
clear plateau from T + 5000 s to T + 11 000 s, and then a
regular late decay. We also present evidence of the jet break at
later times, with a temporal index in good agreement with the
temporal slope obtained from X-ray observations. Although many
of the features observed in the optical light curves of gamma-
ray bursts are usually well explained by a reverse shock (RS) or
forward shock (FS), the shallowness of the optical rise and
enhanced peak emission in the GRB 191016A afterglow is not well
fitted by only a FS or a RS. We propose a theoretical model
which considers both of these components and combines an
evolving FS with a later embedded RS and a subsequent late
energy injection from the central engine activity. We use this
model to successfully explain the temporal evolution of the
light curves and discuss its implications on the fireball
properties.},
