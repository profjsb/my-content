 abstract = {We report on the results of R-band observations of the error box of the
\ensuremathγ-ray burst of 1997 August 28 made between 4
hr and 8 days after this burst occurred. No counterpart was
found varying by more than 0.2 mag down to R=23.8. We discuss
the consequences of this nondetection for relativistic blast
wave models of \ensuremathγ-ray bursts and the possible
effect of redshift on the relation between optical absorption
and the low-energy cutoff in the X-ray afterglow spectrum.},
