 abstract = {The Palomar Transient Factory (PTF) is systematically charting the
optical transient and variable sky. A primary science driver of
PTF is building a complete inventory of transients in the local
universe (distance less than 200 Mpc). Here, we report the
discovery of PTF 10fqs, a transient in the luminosity ``gap''
between novae and supernovae. Located on a spiral arm of Messier
99, PTF 10fqs has a peak luminosity of M$_r$ = -12.3, red
color (g - r = 1.0), and is slowly evolving (decayed by 1 mag in
68 days). It has a spectrum dominated by intermediate-width
H\ensuremathα (\ensuremath≈930 km s$^-1$)
and narrow calcium emission lines. The explosion signature (the
light curve and spectra) is overall similar to that of M85
OT2006-1, SN 2008S, and NGC 300 OT. The origin of these events
is shrouded in mystery and controversy (and in some cases, in
dust). PTF 10fqs shows some evidence of a broad feature (around
8600 ̊A) that may suggest very large velocities
(\ensuremath≈10,000 km s$^-1$) in this explosion.
Ongoing surveys can be expected to find a few such events per
year. Sensitive spectroscopy, infrared monitoring, and
statistics (e.g., disk versus bulge) will eventually make it
possible for astronomers to unravel the nature of these
mysterious explosions.},
