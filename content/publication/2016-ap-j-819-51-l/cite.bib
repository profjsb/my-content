 abstract = {We present late time multi-wavelength observations of Swift J1644+57,
suggested to be a relativistic tidal disruption flare (TDF). Our
observations extend to &gt;4 years from discovery and show that
1.4 years after outburst the relativistic jet switched off on a
timescale less than tens of days, corresponding to a power-law
decay faster than t$^-70$. Beyond this point weak X-rays
continue to be detected at an approximately constant luminosity
of L$_X$ ̃ 5 × 10$^42$ erg s$^-1$ and are
marginally inconsistent with a continuing decay of t$^-5/3$,
similar to that seen prior to the switch-off. Host photometry
enables us to infer a black hole mass of M$_BH$ = 3
× 10$^6$ M$_☉$, consistent with the late time
X-ray luminosity arising from sub-Eddington accretion onto the
black hole in the form of either an unusually optically faint
active galactic nucleus or a slowly varying phase of the
transient. Optical/IR observations show a clear bump in the
light curve at timescales of 30-50 days, with a peak magnitude
(corrected for host galaxy extinction) of M$_R$ ̃ -22 to -23.
The luminosity of the bump is significantly higher than seen in
other, non-relativistic TDFs and does not match any re-
brightening seen at X-ray or radio wavelengths. Its luminosity,
light curve shape, and spectrum are broadly similar to those
seen in superluminous supervnovae, although subject to large
uncertainties in the correction of the significant host
extinction. We discuss these observations in the context of both
TDF and massive star origins for Swift J1644+5734 and other
candidate relativistic tidal flares.},
