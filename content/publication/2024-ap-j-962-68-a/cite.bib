 abstract = {One of the open questions following the discovery of GW170817 is whether
neutron star (NS) mergers are the only astrophysical sites
capable of producing r-process elements. Simulations have shown
that 0.01–0.1 M $_\ensuremathødot$ of
r-process material could be generated in the outflows
originating from the accretion disk surrounding the rapidly
rotating black hole that forms as a remnant to both NS mergers
and collapsing massive stars associated with long-duration
gamma-ray bursts (collapsars). The hallmark signature of
r-process nucleosynthesis in the binary NS merger GW170817 was
its long-lasting near-infrared (NIR) emission, thus motivating a
systematic photometric study of the light curves of broad-lined
stripped-envelope (Ic-BL) supernovae (SNe) associated with
collapsars. We present the first systematic study of 25 SNe Ic-
BL—including 18 observed with the Zwicky Transient
Facility and 7 from the literature—in the
optical/NIR bands to determine what quantity of r-process
material, if any, is synthesized in these explosions. Using
semi-analytic models designed to account for r-process
production in SNe Ic-BL, we perform light curve fitting to
derive constraints on the r-process mass for these SNe. We also
perform independent light curve fits to models without the
r-process. We find that the r-process-free models are a better
fit to the light curves of the objects in our sample. Thus, we
find no compelling evidence of r-process enrichment in any of
our objects. Further high-cadence infrared photometric studies
and nebular spectroscopic analysis would be sensitive to smaller
quantities of r-process ejecta mass or indicate whether all
collapsars are completely devoid of r-process nucleosynthesis.},
