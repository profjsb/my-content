 abstract = {Dust extinction and reddening are ubiquitous in astronomical
observations and are often a major source of systematic
uncertainty. We present here a study of the correlation between
extinction in the Milky Way and the equivalent width of the Na I
D absorption doublet. Our sample includes more than 100 high-
resolution spectra from the Keck telescopes and nearly a million
low-resolution spectra from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS).
We measure the correlation to unprecedented precision, constrain
its shape and derive an empirical relation between these
quantities with a dispersion of the order of 0.15 mag in E(B -
V). From the shape of the curve of growth we further show that a
typical sight line through the Galaxy, as seen within the SDSS
footprint, crosses about three dust clouds. We provide a brief
guide on how to best estimate extinction to extragalactic
sources such as supernovae, using the Na I D absorption feature,
under a variety of circumstances.},
