 abstract = {The discovery of fading but relatively long-lived X-ray emission
accompanying \ensuremathγ-ray bursts has revolutionized
the study of these objects. This `afterglow' is most easily
explained by models similar to those describing supernovae, but
with relativistic ejecta. And as with supernovae, afterglow
measurements should in principle provide important constraints
on burst properties, permitting, for example, estimates of the
amount of energy released, the geometry of the emitting surface
and the density of the ambient medium. Here we report infrared
observations of the fading optical transient associated with the
burst of 14 December 1997 (GRB971214; ref. 6). We detect a
`break' in the broad-band spectrum, as predicted by afterglow
models, which constrains the total energy in the burst to be
&gt;10$^51$erg. Combining the fluence of optical afterglow
with the redshift (z = 3.42; ref. 7), we estimate that the
energy released in the afterglow alone was 2×
10$^51$erg. Estimates of afterglow energetics are less
likely to be subject to geometric effects-such as beaming-that
render uncertain estimates of the total burst energy, but it
nevertheless appears from our measurements that
\ensuremathγ-ray bursts may be much more energetic than
the 10$^51$erg usually assumed.},
