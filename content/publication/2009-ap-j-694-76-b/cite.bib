 abstract = {Several correlations among parameters derived from modeling the high-
energy properties of gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) have been reported.
We show that well known examples of these have common features
indicative of strong contamination by selection effects. We
focus here on the impact of detector threshold truncation on the
spectral peak versus isotropic equivalent energy release (E
$_pk$-E $_iso$) relation, extended to a large sample of 218
Swift and 56 HETE-2 GRBs with and without measured redshift. The
existence of faint Swift events missing from pre-Swift surveys
calls into question inferences based on pre-Swift surveys which
must be subject to complicated incompleteness effects. We
demonstrate a generalized method for treating data truncation in
correlation analyses and apply this method to Swift and pre-
Swift data. Also, we show that the E $_pk$-E
$_\ensuremathγ$ (``Ghirlanda'') correlation is
effectively independent of the GRB redshifts, which suggests
that its existence has little to do with intrinsic physics. We
suggest that a physically based correlation, manifest
observationally, must show significantly reduced scatter in the
rest frame relative to the observer frame and must not persist
if the assumed redshifts are scattered. As with the E $_pk$-E
$_\ensuremathγ$ correlation, we find that the pre-
Swift, bright GRB E $_pk$-E $_iso$ correlation of Amati does
not rigorously satisfy these conditions.},
