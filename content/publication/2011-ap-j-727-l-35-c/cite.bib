 abstract = {We present the first results of an ongoing campaign using the STIS
spectrograph on board the Hubble Space Telescope (HST), whose
primary goal is the study of near-ultraviolet (UV) spectra of
local Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia). Using events identified by
the Palomar Transient Factory and subsequently verified by
ground-based spectroscopy, we demonstrate the ability to locate
and classify SNe Ia as early as 16 days prior to maximum light.
This enables us to trigger HST in a non-disruptive mode to
obtain near UV spectra within a few days of maximum light for
comparison with earlier equivalent ground-based spectroscopic
campaigns conducted at intermediate-redshifts,
\bar\z\â‰ƒ 0.5. We analyze the spectra of 12 SNe Ia
located in the Hubble flow with 0.01 &lt; z &lt; 0.08.
Although a fraction of our eventual sample, these data, together
with archival data, already provide a substantial advance over
that previously available. Restricting samples to those of
similar phase and stretch, the mean UV spectrum agrees
reasonably closely with that at intermediate redshift, although
some differences are found in the metallic absorption features.
A larger sample will determine whether these differences reflect
possible biases or are a genuine evolutionary effect.
Significantly, the wavelength-dependent dispersion, which is
larger in the UV, follows similar trends to those observed at
intermediate redshift and is driven, in part, by differences in
the various metallic features. While the origin of the UV
dispersion remains uncertain, our comparison suggests that it
may reflect compositional variations among our sample rather
than being predominantly an evolutionary effect.},
