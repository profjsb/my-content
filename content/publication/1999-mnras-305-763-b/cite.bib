 abstract = {We find the distribution of coalescence times, birth rates, spatial
velocities, and subsequent radial offsets of coalescing neutron
stars (NSs) in various galactic potentials accounting for large
asymmetric kicks introduced during a supernova. The birth rates
of bound NS-NS binaries are quite sensitive to the magnitude of
the kick velocities but are, nevertheless, similar
(åisebox-0.5ex~ 10 per galaxy per Myr) to
previous population synthesis studies. The distribution of
merger times since zero-age main sequence is, however,
relatively insensitive to the choice of kick velocities. With a
median merger time of \i̊sebox-0.5ex~ 108̂ yr,
we find that compact binaries should closely trace the star
formation rate in the Universe. In a range of plausible galactic
potentials (with M_galaxy3x10\0̂ M_solar) the median radial
offset of a NS-NS merger is less than 10 kpc. At a redshift of
z=1 (with H_0=65 km s\^ ̂Mpc\^-ând Omega=0.2), this means
that half the coalescences should occur within
\rs̊ebox-0.5ex~1.3 arcsec from the host galaxy.
In all but the most shallow potentials, 90 per cent of NS-NS
binaries merge within 30 kpc of the host. We find that although
the spatial distribution of coalescing neutron star binaries is
consistent with the close spatial association of known optical
afterglows of gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) with faint galaxies, a
non-negligible fraction (\rae̊box-0.5ex~15 per
cent) of GRBs should occur well outside (30 kpc) dwarf galaxy
hosts. Extinction owing to dust in the host, projection of
offsets, and a range in interstellar medium densities confound
the true distribution of NS-NS mergers around galaxies with an
observable set of optical transients/galaxy offsets.},
