 abstract = {Classification of periodic variable light curves is important for
scientific knowledge discovery and efficient use of telescopic
resources for source follow-up. In practice, labeled light
curves from catalogs with hundreds of flux measurements (the
training set) may be used to classify curves from ongoing
surveys with tens of flux measurements (the test set).
Statistical classifiers generally assume that the probability of
class given light curve features is the same for training and
test sets. This assumption is unlikely to hold when the number
of flux measurements per light curve varies widely between the
two sets. We employ two methods to correct the
problemâ€”noisification and denoisification. With
noisification we alter the training set to mimic the
distribution of the test set and then construct a classifier on
these altered data. With denoisification we construct a
classifier on the well-sampled curves in the training set and
probabilistically infer what poorly sampled curves in the test
set would look like if we continued obtaining flux measurements.
On periodic variable sources from a simulated data set and the
OGLE survey, both of these methods outperform making no
adjustments for training-test set differences. <P />},
