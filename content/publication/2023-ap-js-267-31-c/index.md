abstract: 'SkyPortal is an open-source software package designed to discover interesting
  transients efficiently, manage follow-up, perform characterization, and visualize
  the results. By enabling fast access to archival and catalog data, crossmatching
  heterogeneous data streams, and the triggering and monitoring of on-demand observations
  for further characterization, a SkyPortal-based platform has been operating at scale
  for >2 yr for the Zwicky Transient Facility Phase II community, with hundreds of
  users, containing tens of millions of time-domain sources, interacting with dozens
  of telescopes, and enabling community reporting. While SkyPortal emphasizes rich
  user experiences across common front-end workflows, recognizing that scientific
  inquiry is increasingly performed programmatically, SkyPortal also surfaces an extensive
  and well-documented application programming interface system. From back-end and
  front-end software to data science analysis tools and visualization frameworks,
  the SkyPortal design emphasizes the reuse and leveraging of best-in- class approaches,
  with a strong extensibility ethos. For instance, SkyPortal now leverages ChatGPT
  large language models to generate and surface source-level human-readable summaries
  automatically. With the imminent restart of the next generation of gravitational-wave
  detectors, SkyPortal now also includes dedicated multimessenger features addressing
  the requirements of rapid multimessenger follow-up: multitelescope management, team/group
  organizing interfaces, and crossmatching of multimessenger data streams with time-domain
  optical surveys, with interfaces sufficiently intuitive for newcomers to the field.
  This paper focuses on the detailed implementations, capabilities, and early science
  results that establish SkyPortal as a community software package ready to take on
  the data science challenges and opportunities presented by this next chapter in
  the multimessenger era.'
