 abstract = {SkyPortal is an open-source software package designed to discover
interesting transients efficiently, manage follow-up, perform
characterization, and visualize the results. By enabling fast
access to archival and catalog data, crossmatching heterogeneous
data streams, and the triggering and monitoring of on-demand
observations for further characterization, a SkyPortal-based
platform has been operating at scale for >2 yr for the Zwicky
Transient Facility Phase II community, with hundreds of users,
containing tens of millions of time-domain sources, interacting
with dozens of telescopes, and enabling community reporting.
While SkyPortal emphasizes rich user experiences across common
front-end workflows, recognizing that scientific inquiry is
increasingly performed programmatically, SkyPortal also surfaces
an extensive and well-documented application programming
interface system. From back-end and front-end software to data
science analysis tools and visualization frameworks, the
SkyPortal design emphasizes the reuse and leveraging of best-in-
class approaches, with a strong extensibility ethos. For
instance, SkyPortal now leverages ChatGPT large language models
to generate and surface source-level human-readable summaries
automatically. With the imminent restart of the next generation
of gravitational-wave detectors, SkyPortal now also includes
dedicated multimessenger features addressing the requirements of
rapid multimessenger follow-up: multitelescope management,
team/group organizing interfaces, and crossmatching of
multimessenger data streams with time-domain optical surveys,
with interfaces sufficiently intuitive for newcomers to the
field. This paper focuses on the detailed implementations,
capabilities, and early science results that establish SkyPortal
as a community software package ready to take on the data
science challenges and opportunities presented by this next
chapter in the multimessenger era.},
