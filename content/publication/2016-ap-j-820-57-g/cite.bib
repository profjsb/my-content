 abstract = {The radius and surface composition of an exploding massive star, as well
as the explosion energy per unit mass, can be measured using
early UV observations of core-collapse supernovae (SNe). We
present the first results from a simultaneous GALEX/PTF search
for early ultraviolet (UV) emission from SNe. Six SNe II and one
Type II superluminous SN (SLSN-II) are clearly detected in the
GALEX near-UV (NUV) data. We compare our detection rate with
theoretical estimates based on early, shock-cooling UV light
curves calculated from models that fit existing Swift and GALEX
observations well, combined with volumetric SN rates. We find
that our observations are in good agreement with calculated
rates assuming that red supergiants (RSGs) explode with fiducial
radii of 500 R $_☉$, explosion energies of 10$^51$ erg,
and ejecta masses of 10 M $_☉$. Exploding blue supergiants and
Wolf-Rayet stars are poorly constrained. We describe how such
observations can be used to derive the progenitor radius,
surface composition, and explosion energy per unit mass of such
SN events, and we demonstrate why UV observations are critical
for such measurements. We use the fiducial RSG parameters to
estimate the detection rate of SNe during the shock-cooling
phase (&lt;1 day after explosion) for several ground-based
surveys (PTF, ZTF, and LSST). We show that the proposed wide-
field UV explorer ULTRASAT mission is expected to find &gt;85
SNe per year (̃0.5 SN per deg$^2$), independent of host galaxy
extinction, down to an NUV detection limit of 21.5 mag AB. Our
pilot GALEX/PTF project thus convincingly demonstrates that a
dedicated, systematic SN survey at the NUV band is a compelling
method to study how massive stars end their life. <P />},
