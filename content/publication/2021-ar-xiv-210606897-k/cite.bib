 abstract = {We present optical follow-up imaging obtained with the Katzman Automatic
Imaging Telescope, Las Cumbres Observatory Global Telescope
Network, Nickel Telescope, Swope Telescope, and Thacher
Telescope of the LIGO/Virgo gravitational wave (GW) signal from
the neutron star-black hole (NSBH) merger GW190814. We searched
the GW190814 localization region (19 deg$^2$ for the 90th
percentile best localization), covering a total of 51 deg$^2$
and 94.6% of the two-dimensional localization region. Analyzing
the properties of 189 transients that we consider as candidate
counterparts to the NSBH merger, including their localizations,
discovery times from merger, optical spectra, likely host-galaxy
redshifts, and photometric evolution, we conclude that none of
these objects are likely to be associated with GW190814. Based
on this finding, we consider the likely optical properties of an
electromagnetic counterpart to GW190814, including possible
kilonovae and short gamma-ray burst afterglows. Using the joint
limits from our follow-up imaging, we conclude that a
counterpart with an $r$-band decline rate of 0.68 mag
day$^-1$, similar to the kilonova AT 2017gfo, could peak at an
absolute magnitude of at most $-17.8$ mag (50% confidence). Our
data are not constraining for ``red'' kilonovae and rule out
``blue'' kilonovae with $M>0.5 M_ødot$ (30% confidence). We
strongly rule out all known types of short gamma-ray burst
afterglows with viewing angles $<$17$^∘$ assuming an
initial jet opening angle of $∼$$5.2^∘$ and explosion
energies and circumburst densities similar to afterglows
explored in the literature. Finally, we explore the possibility
that GW190814 merged in the disk of an active galactic nucleus,
of which we find four in the localization region, but we do not
find any candidate counterparts among these sources.},
