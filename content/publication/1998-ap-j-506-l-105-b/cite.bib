 abstract = {The spatial and temporal coincidence of gamma-ray burst (GRB) 980425 and
supernova (SN) 1998bw has prompted speculation that there exists
a subclass of GRBs produced by SNe (``S-GRBs''). A physical
model motivated by radio observations lead us to propose the
following characteristics of S-GRBs: (1) prompt radio emission
and an implied high brightness temperature close to the inverse
Compton limit, (2) high expansion velocity
(&gt;åisebox-0.5ex~50,000 km s$^-1$) of the
optical photosphere as derived from lines widths and energy
release larger than usual, (3) no long-lived X-ray afterglow,
and (4) a single-pulse GRB profile. Radio studies of previous
SNe show that only (but not all) Type Ib and Ic SNe potentially
satisfy the first condition. We investigate the proposed
associations of GRBs and SNe within the context of these
proposed criteria and suggest that
\i̊sebox-0.5ex~1% of GRBs detected by BATSE
may be members of this subclass.},
