abstract: We present optical and near-infrared photometric observations of GRB 191016
  with the COATLI, DDOTI and RATIR ground-based telescopes over the first three nights.
  We present the temporal evolution of the optical afterglow and describe 5 different
  stages that were not completely characterized in previous works, mainly due to scarcity
  of data points to accurately fit the different components of the optical emission.
  After the end of the prompt gamma-ray emission, we observed the afterglow rise slowly
  in the optical and near-infrared (NIR) wavelengths and peak at around T+1450s in
  all filters. This was followed by an early decay, a clear plateau from T+5000s to
  T+11000s, and then a regular late decay. We also present evidence of the jet break
  at later times, with a temporal index in good agreement with the temporal slope
  obtained from X-ray observations. Although many of the features observed in the
  optical light curves of GRBs are usually well explained by a reverse shock (RS)
  or forward shock(FS), the shallowness of the optical rise and enhanced peak emission
  in the GRB191016A afterglow is not well-fitted by only a FS or a RS. We propose
  a theoretical model which considers both of these components and combines an evolving
  FS with a later embedded RS and a subsequent late energy injection from the central
  engine activity. We use this model to successfully explain the temporal evolution
  of the light curves and discuss its implications on the fireball properties.
