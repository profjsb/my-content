 abstract = {This paper presents the first results from a new citizen science
project: Galaxy Zoo Supernovae. This proof-of-concept project
uses members of the public to identify supernova candidates from
the latest generation of wide-field imaging transient surveys.
We describe the Galaxy Zoo Supernovae operations and scoring
model, and demonstrate the effectiveness of this novel method
using imaging data and transients from the Palomar Transient
Factory (PTF). We examine the results collected over the period
2010 April-July, during which nearly 14 000 supernova candidates
from the PTF were classified by more than 2500 individuals
within a few hours of data collection. We compare the transients
selected by the citizen scientists to those identified by
experienced PTF scanners and find the agreement to be remarkable
- Galaxy Zoo Supernovae performs comparably to the PTF scanners
and identified as transients 93 per cent of the ̃130
spectroscopically confirmed supernovae (SNe) that the PTF
located during the trial period (with no false positive
identifications). Further analysis shows that only a small
fraction of the lowest signal-to-noise ratio detections (r &gt;
19.5) are given low scores: Galaxy Zoo Supernovae correctly
identifies all SNe with
\ensuremath≥8\ensuremathσ detections in the PTF
imaging data. The Galaxy Zoo Supernovae project has direct
applicability to future transient searches, such as the Large
Synoptic Survey Telescope, by both rapidly identifying candidate
transient events and via the training and improvement of
existing machine classifier algorithms. This publication has
been made possible by the participation of more than 10 000
volunteers in the Galaxy Zoo Supernovae project ().},
