 abstract = {Recent observations suggest that global properties of the host galaxies
for long-duration \ensuremathγ-ray bursts (GRBs) are
particularly well suited for creating the massive star
progenitors of these GRBs. Motivated by the hypothesis that
massive young star clusters located in metal-poor, low-
metallicity galaxies are a natural birth site for GRB
progenitors, we present a comparison study of the ISM properties
along the sight line toward the super star cluster NGC 1705-1
and those in distant GRB hosts. Using the same set of metal
transitions in the UV and applying known ISM structures in NGC
1705, we find that NGC 1705-1 resembles distant GRB host
galaxies in its high neutral gas column, low molecular gas
fraction, low metallicity, \ensuremathα-element
enhancement, and low dust depletion. The lack of molecular gas
is due to the enhanced UV radiation field in the starburst
environment, consistent with the expectations for GRB
progenitors. In addition, the known presence of dense neutral
gas clouds at r&lt;åisebox-0.5ex~500 pc from
NGC 1705-1 provides a natural reservoir of C$^+$, Si$^+$,
and Fe$^+$ ions that may be subsequently excited by the
afterglow UV radiation field to produce excited lines commonly
seen in GRB host ISM. We further argue that the apparent offset
in the velocity profiles of low- and high-ionization transitions
from absorption-line observations alone already offers important
clues for related starburst episodes in GRB host galaxies. Our
study shows that a statistical comparison between the ISM around
star clusters and high-redshift GRB progenitors is important for
identifying the key physical parameters that facilitate the
formation of GRBs.},
