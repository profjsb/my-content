 abstract = {We present broadband (gamma-ray, X-ray, near-infrared, optical, and
radio) observations of the Swift gamma-ray burst (GRB) 090709A
and its afterglow in an effort to ascertain the origin of this
high-energy transient. Previous analyses suggested that GRB
090709A exhibited quasi-periodic oscillations with a period of
8.06 s, a trait unknown in long-duration GRBs but typical of
flares from soft gamma-ray repeaters. When properly accounting
for the underlying shape of the power-density spectrum of GRB
090709A, we find no conclusive (&gt;3\ensuremathσ)
evidence for the reported periodicity. In conjunction with the
location of the transient (far from the Galactic plane and
absent any nearby host galaxy in the local universe) and the
evidence for extinction in excess of the Galactic value, we
consider a magnetar origin relatively unlikely. A long-duration
GRB, however, can account for the majority of the observed
properties of this source. GRB 090709A is distinguished from
other long-duration GRBs primarily by the large amount of
obscuration from its host galaxy (A $_ K,obs$
&gt;åisebox-0.5ex~ 2 mag).},
