 abstract = {We report the discovery by the Palomar Transient Factory (PTF) of the
transient source PTF11agg, which is distinguished by three
primary characteristics: (1) bright (R $_peak$ = 18.3 mag),
rapidly fading (\ensuremathΔR = 4 mag in
\ensuremathΔt = 2 days) optical transient emission; (2)
a faint (R = 26.2 \ensuremath± 0.2 mag), blue (g' - R =
0.17 \ensuremath± 0.29 mag) quiescent optical counterpart;
and (3) an associated year-long, scintillating radio transient.
We argue that these observed properties are inconsistent with
any known class of Galactic transients (flare stars, X-ray
binaries, dwarf novae), and instead suggest a cosmological
origin. The detection of incoherent radio emission at such
distances implies a large emitting region, from which we infer
the presence of relativistic ejecta. The observed properties are
all consistent with the population of long-duration gamma-ray
bursts (GRBs), marking the first time such an outburst has been
discovered in the distant universe independent of a high-energy
trigger. We searched for possible high-energy counterparts to
PTF11agg, but found no evidence for associated prompt emission.
We therefore consider three possible scenarios to account for a
GRB-like afterglow without a high-energy counterpart: an
``untriggered'' GRB (lack of satellite coverage), an ``orphan''
afterglow (viewing-angle effects), and a ``dirty fireball''
(suppressed high-energy emission). The observed optical and
radio light curves appear inconsistent with even the most basic
predictions for off-axis afterglow models. The simplest
explanation, then, is that PTF11agg is a normal, on-axis long-
duration GRB for which the associated high-energy emission was
simply missed. However, we have calculated the likelihood of
such a serendipitous discovery by PTF and find that it is quite
small (\ensuremath≈2.6%). While not definitive, we
nonetheless speculate that PTF11agg may represent a new, more
common (&gt;4 times the on-axis GRB rate at 90% confidence)
class of relativistic outbursts lacking associated high-energy
emission. If so, such sources will be uncovered in large numbers
by future wide-field optical and radio transient surveys.},
