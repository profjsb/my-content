 abstract = {On 2011 May 31 UT a supernova (SN) exploded in the nearby galaxy M51
(the Whirlpool Galaxy). We discovered this event using small
telescopes equipped with CCD cameras and also detected it with
the Palomar Transient Factory survey, rapidly confirming it to
be a Type II SN. Here, we present multi-color ultraviolet
through infrared photometry which is used to calculate the
bolometric luminosity and a series of spectra. Our early-time
observations indicate that SN 2011dh resulted from the explosion
of a relatively compact progenitor star. Rapid shock-breakout
cooling leads to relatively low temperatures in early-time
spectra, compared to explosions of red supergiant stars, as well
as a rapid early light curve decline. Optical spectra of SN
2011dh are dominated by H lines out to day 10 after explosion,
after which He I lines develop. This SN is likely a member of
the cIIb (compact IIb) class, with progenitor radius larger than
that of SN 2008ax and smaller than the eIIb (extended IIb) SN
1993J progenitor. Our data imply that the object identified in
pre-explosion Hubble Space Telescope images at the SN location
is possibly a companion to the progenitor or a blended source,
and not the progenitor star itself, as its radius
(Ã¥isebox-0.5ex~10$^13$ cm) would be highly
inconsistent with constraints from our post-explosion spectra.},
