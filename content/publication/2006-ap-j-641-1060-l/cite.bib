 abstract = {The stars that end their lives as supernovae (SNe) have been directly
observed in only a handful of cases, mainly because of the
extreme difficulty of identifying them in images obtained prior
to the SN explosions. Here we report the identification of the
progenitor for the recent Type II-plateau (core collapse) SN
2005cs in pre-explosion archival images of the Whirlpool Galaxy
(M51) obtained with the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) Advanced
Camera for Surveys (ACS). From high-quality ground-based images
of the SN obtained with the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope, we
precisely determine the position of the SN and are able to
isolate the SN progenitor to within 0.04`` in the HST ACS
optical images. We further pinpoint the SN location to within
0.005'' from HST ACS ultraviolet images of the SN, confirming
our progenitor identification. From photometry of the SN
progenitor obtained with the pre-SN ACS images, and also from
limits to its brightness in pre-SN HST NICMOS images, we infer
that the progenitor is a red supergiant star of spectral type
K3-M4 with initial mass 10+/-3 M$_solar$. We also discuss the
implications of the SN 2005cs progenitor identification and its
mass estimate. There is an emerging trend that the most common
Type II-plateau SNe originate from low-mass supergiants (8-20
M$_solar$).},
