 abstract = {Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) are thermonuclear explosions of degenerate
white dwarf stars destabilized by mass accretion from a
companion star$^1$, but the nature of their progenitors
remains poorly understood. A way to discriminate between
progenitor systems is through radio observations; a non-
degenerate companion star is expected to lose material through
winds$^2$ or binary interaction$^3$ before explosion, and
the supernova ejecta crashing into this nearby circumstellar
material should result in radio synchrotron emission. However,
despite extensive efforts, no type Ia supernova (SN Ia) has ever
been detected at radio wavelengths, which suggests a clean
environment and a companion star that is itself a degenerate
white dwarf star$^4,5$. Here we report on the study of SN
2020eyj, a SN Ia showing helium-rich circumstellar material, as
demonstrated by its spectral features, infrared emission and,
for the first time in a SN Ia to our knowledge, a radio
counterpart. On the basis of our modelling, we conclude that the
circumstellar material probably originates from a single-
degenerate binary system in which a white dwarf accretes
material from a helium donor star, an often proposed formation
channel for SNe Ia (refs. $^6,7$). We describe how
comprehensive radio follow-up of SN 2020eyj-like SNe Ia can
improve the constraints on their progenitor systems.},
