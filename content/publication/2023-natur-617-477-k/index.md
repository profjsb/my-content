abstract: Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) are thermonuclear explosions of degenerate white
  dwarf stars destabilized by mass accretion from a companion star$^1$, but the nature
  of their progenitors remains poorly understood. A way to discriminate between progenitor
  systems is through radio observations; a non- degenerate companion star is expected
  to lose material through winds$^2$ or binary interaction$^3$ before explosion, and
  the supernova ejecta crashing into this nearby circumstellar material should result
  in radio synchrotron emission. However, despite extensive efforts, no type Ia supernova
  (SN Ia) has ever been detected at radio wavelengths, which suggests a clean environment
  and a companion star that is itself a degenerate white dwarf star$^4,5$. Here we
  report on the study of SN 2020eyj, a SN Ia showing helium-rich circumstellar material,
  as demonstrated by its spectral features, infrared emission and, for the first time
  in a SN Ia to our knowledge, a radio counterpart. On the basis of our modelling,
  we conclude that the circumstellar material probably originates from a single- degenerate
  binary system in which a white dwarf accretes material from a helium donor star,
  an often proposed formation channel for SNe Ia (refs. $^6,7$). We describe how comprehensive
  radio follow-up of SN 2020eyj-like SNe Ia can improve the constraints on their progenitor
  systems.
