 abstract = {We present analytical and numerical models of the bright long GRB
210822A at z = 1.736. The intrinsic extreme brightness exhibited
in the optical, which is very similar to other bright GRBs (e.g.
GRBs 080319B, 130427A, 160625A 190114C, and 221009A), makes GRB
210822A an ideal case for studying the evolution of this
particular kind of GRB. We use optical data from the RATIR
instrument starting at T + 315.9 s, with publicly available
optical data from other ground-based observatories, as well as
Swift/UVOT, and X-ray data from the Swift/XRT instrument. The
temporal profiles and spectral properties during the late stages
align consistently with the conventional forward shock model,
complemented by a reverse shock element that dominates optical
emissions during the initial phases (T < 300 s). Furthermore, we
observe a break at T = 80 000 s that we interpreted as evidence
of a jet break, which constrains the opening angle to be about
\ensuremathþeta$_j$ = (3-5) degrees. Finally, we apply a
machine-learning technique to model the multiwavelength light
curve of GRB 210822A using the AFTERGLOWPY LIBRARY. We estimate
the angle of sight \ensuremathþeta$_obs$ = (6.4
\ensuremath± 0.1) × 10$^-1$ degrees, the
energy E$_0$ = (7.9 \ensuremath± 1.6) ×
10$^53$ erg, the electron index p = 2.54 \ensuremath±
0.10, the thermal energy fraction in electrons ϵ$_e$ = (4.63
\ensuremath± 0.91) × 10$^-5$ and in the
magnetic field ϵ$_B$ = (8.66 \ensuremath± 1.01)
× 10$^-6$, the efficiency \ensuremathχ =
0.89 \ensuremath± 0.01, and the density of the surrounding
medium n$_0$ = 0.85 \ensuremath± 0.01 cm$^-3$.},
