 abstract = {R. Chornock, D. A. Perley, and J. S. Bloom, University of California,
Berkeley, report that inspection of spectra (range 310-925 nm)
obtained on Feb. 19.61 UT with LRIS on the Keck-I 10-m telescope
reveals that 2009V (cf. CBET 1680) is a type-Ia supernova;
cross-correlation with a library of supernova spectra using the
``SuperNova IDentification'' code (SNID; Blondin and Tonry 2007,
Ap.J. 666, 1024) indicates that the redshift is 0.093 +/- 0.003
and that 2009V is 10.5 +/- 1.1 days after maximum light. Spectra
obtained on Feb. 19.68 of 2009ae (cf. CBET 1696) reveal that it
is also a type-Ia supernova; SNID finds a best match with SN
1999ee at an age of 20 days after maximum light.},
