 abstract = {The discovery of a transient kilonova following the gravitational-wave
(GW) event GW170817 highlighted the critical need for
coordinated rapid and wide-field observations, inference, and
follow-up across the electromagnetic spectrum. In the southern
hemisphere, the Dark Energy Camera (DECam) on the Blanco 4 m
telescope is well suited to this task, as it is able to cover
wide fields quickly while still achieving the depths required to
find kilonovae like the one accompanying GW170817 to ̃500 Mpc,
the binary neutron star (NS) horizon distance for current
generation of LIGO/Virgo collaboration (LVC) interferometers.
Here, as part of the multi-facility follow-up by the Global
Relay of Observatories Watching Transients Happen collaboration,
we describe the observations and automated data movement, data
reduction, candidate discovery, and vetting pipeline of our
target-of-opportunity DECam observations of S190426c, the first
possible NS-black hole merger detected in GWs. Starting 7.5 hr
after S190426c, over 11.28 hr of observations, we imaged an area
of 525 deg$^2$ (r band) and 437 deg$^2$ (z band); this was
16.3% of the total original localization probability, and
nearly all of the probability visible from the southern
hemisphere. The machine-learning-based pipeline was optimized
for fast turnaround, delivering transients for human vetting
within 17 minutes, on average, of shutter closure. We reported
nine promising counterpart candidates 2.5 hr before the end of
our observations. One hour after our data-taking ended (roughly
20 hr after the announcement of S190426c), LVC released a
refined skymap that reduced the probability coverage of our
observations to 8.0%, demonstrating a critical need for
localization updates on shorter (̃hour) timescales. Our
observations yielded no detection of a bona fide counterpart to
m $_ z $ = 21.7 and m $_ r $ = 22.2 at the
5\ensuremathσ level of significance, consistent with
the refined LVC positioning. We view these observations and
rapid inferencing as an important real-world test for this novel
end-to-end wide-field pipeline.},
