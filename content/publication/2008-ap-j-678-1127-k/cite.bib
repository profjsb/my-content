 abstract = {GRB 070610 is a typical high-energy event with a duration of 5 s. Yet
within the burst localization we detect a highly unusual X-ray
and optical transient, Swift J195509.6+261406. We see high-
amplitude X-ray and optical variability on very short timescales
even at late times. Using near-infrared imaging assisted by a
laser guide star and adaptive optics, we identified the
counterpart of Swift J195509.6+261406. Late-time optical and
near-infrared imaging constrain the spectral type of the
counterpart to be fainter than a K-dwarf, assuming it is of
Galactic origin. It is possible that GRB 070610 and Swift
J195509.6+261406 are unrelated sources. However, the absence of
a typical X-ray afterglow from GRB 070610 in conjunction with
the spatial and temporal coincidence of the two motivate us to
suggest that the sources are related. The closest (imperfect)
analog to Swift J195509.6+261406 is V4641 Sgr, an unusual black
hole binary. We suggest that Swift J195509.6+261406 along with
V4641 Sgr define a subclass of stellar black hole
binariesâ€”the fast X-ray novae. We further suggest
that fast X-ray novae are associated with bursts of gamma rays.
If so, GRB 070610 defines a new class of celestial gamma-ray
bursts and these bursts dominate the long-duration GRB
demographics.},
