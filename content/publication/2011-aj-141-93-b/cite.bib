 abstract = {We present a novel method for the optimal selection of quasars using
time-series observations in a single photometric bandpass.
Utilizing the damped random walk model of Kelly et al., we
parameterize the ensemble quasar structure function in Sloan
Stripe 82 as a function of observed brightness. The ensemble
model fit can then be evaluated rigorously for and calibrated
with individual light curves with no parameter fitting. This
yields a classification in two statistics—one
describing the fit confidence and the other describing the
probability of a false alarm—which can be tuned, a
priori, to achieve high quasar detection fractions (99%
completeness with default cuts), given an acceptable rate of
false alarms. We establish the typical rate of false alarms due
to known variable stars as lsim3% (high purity). Applying the
classification, we increase the sample of potential quasars
relative to those known in Stripe 82 by as much as 29%, and by
nearly a factor of two in the redshift range 2.5 &lt; z &lt;
3, where selection by color is extremely inefficient. This
represents 1875 new quasars in a 290 deg$^2$ field. The
observed rates of both quasars and stars agree well with the
model predictions, with &gt;99% of quasars exhibiting the
expected variability profile. We discuss the utility of the
method at high redshift and in the regime of noisy and sparse
data. Our time-series selection complements well-independent
selection based on quasar colors and has strong potential for
identifying high-redshift quasars for Baryon Acoustic
Oscillations and other cosmology studies in the LSST era.},
