abstract: The Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) performs a systematic neutrino follow-up
  programme, searching for optical counterparts to high- energy neutrinos with dedicated
  Target-of-Opportunity (ToO) observations. Since first light in March 2018, ZTF has
  taken prompt observations for 24 high-quality neutrino alerts from the IceCube Neutrino
  Observatory, with a median latency of 12.2 h from initial neutrino detection. From
  two of these campaigns, we have already reported tidal disruption event (TDE) AT
  2019dsg and likely TDE AT 2019fdr as probable counterparts, suggesting that TDEs
  contribute >7.8 per cent of the astrophysical neutrino flux. We here present the
  full results of our programme through to December 2021. No additional candidate
  neutrino sources were identified by our programme, allowing us to place the first
  constraints on the underlying optical luminosity function of astrophysical neutrino
  sources. Transients with optical absolutes magnitudes brighter that -21 can contribute
  no more than 87 per cent of the total, while transients brighter than -22 can contribute
  no more than 58 per cent of the total, neglecting the effect of extinction and assuming
  they follow the star formation rate. These are the first observational constraints
  on the neutrino emission of bright populations such as superluminous supernovae.
  None of the neutrinos were coincident with bright optical AGN flares comparable
  to that observed for TXS 0506+056/IC170922A, with such optical blazar flares producing
  no more than 26 per cent of the total neutrino flux. We highlight the outlook for
  electromagnetic neutrino follow-up programmes, including the expected potential
  for the Rubin Observatory.
