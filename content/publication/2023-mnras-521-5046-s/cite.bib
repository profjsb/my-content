 abstract = {The Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) performs a systematic neutrino
follow-up programme, searching for optical counterparts to high-
energy neutrinos with dedicated Target-of-Opportunity (ToO)
observations. Since first light in March 2018, ZTF has taken
prompt observations for 24 high-quality neutrino alerts from the
IceCube Neutrino Observatory, with a median latency of 12.2 h
from initial neutrino detection. From two of these campaigns, we
have already reported tidal disruption event (TDE) AT 2019dsg
and likely TDE AT 2019fdr as probable counterparts, suggesting
that TDEs contribute >7.8 per cent of the astrophysical neutrino
flux. We here present the full results of our programme through
to December 2021. No additional candidate neutrino sources were
identified by our programme, allowing us to place the first
constraints on the underlying optical luminosity function of
astrophysical neutrino sources. Transients with optical
absolutes magnitudes brighter that -21 can contribute no more
than 87 per cent of the total, while transients brighter than
-22 can contribute no more than 58 per cent of the total,
neglecting the effect of extinction and assuming they follow the
star formation rate. These are the first observational
constraints on the neutrino emission of bright populations such
as superluminous supernovae. None of the neutrinos were
coincident with bright optical AGN flares comparable to that
observed for TXS 0506+056/IC170922A, with such optical blazar
flares producing no more than 26 per cent of the total neutrino
flux. We highlight the outlook for electromagnetic neutrino
follow-up programmes, including the expected potential for the
Rubin Observatory.},
