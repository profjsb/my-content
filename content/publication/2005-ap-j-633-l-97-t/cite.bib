 abstract = {Observations and modeling for the light curve (LC) and spectra of
supernova (SN) 2005bf are reported. This SN showed unique
features: the LC had two maxima, and declined rapidly after the
second maximum, while the spectra showed strengthening He lines
whose velocity increased with time. The double-peaked LC can be
reproduced by a double-peaked $^56$Ni distribution, with most
$^56$Ni at low velocity and a small amount at high velocity.
The rapid postmaximum decline requires a large fraction of the
\ensuremathγ-rays to escape from the $^56$Ni-
dominated region, possibly because of low-density ``holes.'' The
presence of Balmer lines in the spectrum suggests that the He
layer of the progenitor was substantially intact. Increasing
\ensuremathγ-ray deposition in the He layer due to
enhanced \ensuremathγ-ray escape from the $^56$Ni-
dominated region may explain both the delayed strengthening and
the increasing velocity of the He lines. The SN has massive
ejecta (åisebox-0.5ex~6-7 M$_solar$), normal
kinetic energy [\i̊sebox-0.5ex~(1.0-1.5)
× 10$^51$ ergs], a high peak bolometric
luminosity
(\rs̊ebox-0.5ex~5×10$^42$ ergs
s$^-1$) for an epoch as late as
\rae̊box-0.5ex~ 40 days, and a large $^56$Ni
mass (\raib̊ox-0.5ex~0.32 M$_solar$). These
properties and the presence of a small amount of H suggest that
the progenitor was initially massive
(M\raiso̊x-0.5ex~25-30 M$_solar$) and had
lost most of its H envelope, and was possibly a WN star. The
double-peaked $^56$Ni distribution suggests that the explosion
may have formed jets that did not reach the He layer. The
properties of SN 2005bf resemble those of the explosion of
Cassiopeia A.},
