 abstract = {In this first paper in a series, we present 1298 low-redshift (z
\ensuremathłesssim 0.2) optical spectra of 582 Type Ia
supernovae (SNe Ia) observed from 1989 to 2008 as part of the
Berkeley Supernova Ia Program (BSNIP). 584 spectra of 199 SNe Ia
have well-calibrated light curves with measured distance moduli,
and many of the spectra have been corrected for host-galaxy
contamination. Most of the data were obtained using the Kast
double spectrograph mounted on the Shane 3 m telescope at Lick
Observatory and have a typical wavelength range of 3300-10 400
̊A, roughly twice as wide as spectra from most previously
published data sets. We present our observing and reduction
procedures, and we describe the resulting SN Database, which
will be an online, public, searchable data base containing all
of our fully reduced spectra and companion photometry. In
addition, we discuss our spectral classification scheme (using
the SuperNova IDentification code, SNID; Blondin &amp; Tonry),
utilizing our newly constructed set of SNID spectral templates.
These templates allow us to accurately classify our entire data
set, and by doing so we are able to reclassify a handful of
objects as bona fide SNe Ia and a few other objects as members
of some of the peculiar SN Ia subtypes. In fact, our data set
includes spectra of nearly 90 spectroscopically peculiar SNe Ia.
We also present spectroscopic host-galaxy redshifts of some SNe
Ia where these values were previously unknown. The sheer size of
the BSNIP data set and the consistency of our observation and
reduction methods make this sample unique among all other
published SN Ia data sets and complementary in many ways to the
large, low-redshift SN Ia spectra presented by Matheson et al.
and Blondin et al. In other BSNIP papers in this series, we use
these data to examine the relationships between spectroscopic
characteristics and various observables such as photometric and
host-galaxy properties.},
