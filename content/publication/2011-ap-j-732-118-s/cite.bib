 abstract = {PTF 09dav is a peculiar subluminous Type Ia supernova (SN) discovered by
the Palomar Transient Factory (PTF). Spectroscopically, it
appears superficially similar to the class of subluminous
SN1991bg-like SNe, but it has several unusual features which
make it stand out from this population. Its peak luminosity is
fainter than any previously discovered SN1991bg-like SN Ia
(M$_B$ åisebox-0.5ex~ -15.5), but without
the unusually red optical colors expected if the faint
luminosity were due to extinction. The photospheric optical
spectra have very unusual strong lines of Sc II and Mg I, with
possible Sr II, together with stronger than average Ti II and
low velocities of \i̊sebox-0.5ex~6000 km
s$^-1$. The host galaxy of PTF09dav is ambiguous. The SN lies
either on the extreme outskirts
(\rs̊ebox-0.5ex~41 kpc) of a spiral galaxy or
in an very faint (M$_R$ &gt;= -12.8) dwarf galaxy, unlike
other 1991bg-like SNe which are invariably associated with
massive, old stellar populations. PTF 09dav is also an outlier
on the light-curve-width-luminosity and color-luminosity
relations derived for other subluminous SNe Ia. The inferred
$^56$Ni mass is small (0.019 \ensuremath± 0.003 M
$_sun$), as is the estimated ejecta mass of 0.36 M $_sun$.
Taken together, these properties make PTF 09dav a remarkable
event. We discuss various physical models that could explain PTF
09dav. Helium shell detonation or deflagration on the surface of
a CO white dwarf can explain some of the features of PTF 09dav,
including the presence of Sc and the low photospheric
velocities, but the observed Si and Mg are not predicted to be
very abundant in these models. We conclude that no single model
is currently capable of explaining all of the observed
signatures of PTF 09dav.},
