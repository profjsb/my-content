 abstract = {We present late-time imaging and spectroscopic observations of the
optical transient (OT) and host galaxy of GRB 970508. Imaging
observations roughly 200 and 300 days after the burst provide
unambiguous evidence for the flattening of the light curve. The
spectroscopic observations reveal two persistent features that
we identify with [O II] \ensuremathłambda3727 and [Ne III]
\ensuremathłambda3869 at a redshift of z=0.835--the same
redshift as the absorption system seen when the transient was
bright. The OT was coincident with the underlying galaxy to
better than 370 mas or a projected radial separation of less
than 2.7 kpc. The luminosity of the [O II] line implies a
minimum star formation rate of 1 M$_solar$ yr$^-1$. In our
assumed cosmology, the implied rest-frame absolute magnitude
isM$_B$=-18.55, or L$_B$=0.12 L$_*$. This object, the
likely host of GRB 970508, can thus be characterized as an
actively star-forming dwarf galaxy. The close spatial connection
between this dwarf galaxy and the OT requires that at least some
fraction of gamma-ray burst progenitors are not ejected in even
the weakest galactic potentials. <P />Based on the observations
obtained at the W. M. Keck Observatory which is operated by the
California Association for Research in Astronomy, a scientific
partnership among California Institute of Technology, the
University of California and the National Aeronautics and Space
Administration.},
