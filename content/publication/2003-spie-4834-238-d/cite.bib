 abstract = {Studies of the cosmic gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) and their host galaxies
are now starting to provide interesting or even unique new
insights in observational cosmology. Observed GRB host galaxies
have a median magnitude Råisebox-0.5ex~25 mag,
and show a range of luminosities, morphologies, and star
formation rates, with a median redshift
z\i̊sebox-0.5ex~1. They represent a new way of
identifying a population of star-forming galaxies at
cosmological redshifts, which is mostly independent of the
traditional selection methods. They seem to be broadly similar
to the normal field galaxy populations at comparable redshifts
and magnitudes, and indicate at most a mild luminosity evolution
over the redshift range they probe. Studies of GRB optical
afterglows seen in absorption provide a powerful new probe of
the ISM in dense, central regions of their host galaxies, which
is complementary to the traditional studies using QSO absorption
line systems. Some GRB hosts are heavily obscured, and provide a
new way to select a population of cosmological sub-mm sources. A
census of detected optical tranistents may provide an important
new way to constrain the total obscured fraction of star
formation over the history of the universe. Finally, detection
of GRB afterglows at high redshifts (z&gt;6) may provide a
unique way to probe the primordial star formation, massive IMF,
early IGM, and chemical enrichment at the end of the cosmic
reionization era. <P />},
