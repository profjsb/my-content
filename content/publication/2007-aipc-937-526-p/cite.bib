 abstract = {Long-duration GRBs and X-ray flashes (XRFs softer-spectrum brethren of
long GRBs) are thought to occur following the core-collapse of
massive stars. We report here on observations of a recent X-ray
flash (XRF 060428B) that occurred 2.6$^â€³$ in projection from
the center of a massive red galaxy at redshift z = 0.348, well
within its detectable light. While initial probabilistic
arguments suggested a physical connection, deep Keck imaging
reveals a compact blue source at the burst position, likely a
higher-redshift host galaxy. Since the observed offset is
approximately equal to the Einstein radius of the foreground
elliptical, we suggest that XRF 060428B may have been strongly
gravitationally lensed, allowing us to detect an underluminous
burst at high-z. This would naturally explain the otherwise
coincidental proximity to a nearby galaxy. <P />},
