 abstract = {Following our previous work, we conclude that a GRB standard candle
constructed from the Ghirlanda et al. power-law relation between
the geometry-corrected energy ( E $_\ensuremathγ$)
and the peak of the rest-frame prompt burst spectrum (E$_p$)
is not yet cosmographically useful, despite holding some
potential advantages over SNe Ia. This is due largely to the
small sample of ̃ 20 GRBs with the required measured redshifts,
jet-breaks, and peak energies, and to the strong sensitivity of
the goodness-of-fit of the power-law to input assumptions. The
most important such finding concerns the sensitivity to the
generally unknown density (and density profile), of the
circumburst medium. Although the E$_p$- E
$_\ensuremathγ$ relation is a highly significant
correlation over many cosmologies, until the sample expands to
include many low-z events, it will be most sensitive to
\ensuremathØmega$_M$ but essentially insensitive to
\ensuremathØmega$_\ensuremathŁambda$ and w, with
some hope of constraining dw/dt with high-z GRB data alone. The
relation clearly represents a significant improvement in the
search for an empirical GRB standard candle, but is further
hindered by an unknown physical basis for the relation, the lack
of a low-z training set to calibrate the relation in a
cosmology-independent way, and several major potential
systematic uncertainties and selection effects. Until these
concerns are addressed, a larger sample is acquired, and
attempts are made to marginalize or perform Monte Carlo
simulations over the unknown density distribution, we urge
caution concerning claims of the utility of GRBs for cosmography
and especially the attempts to combine GRBs with SNe Ia. <P />},
