 abstract = {Stellar rotation periods measured from single-age populations are
critical for investigating how stellar angular momentum content
evolves over time, how that evolution depends on mass, and how
rotation influences the stellar dynamo and the magnetically
heated chromosphere and corona. We report rotation periods for
40 late-K to mid-M star members of the nearby, rich,
intermediate-age (åisebox-0.5ex~600 Myr) open
cluster Praesepe. These rotation periods were derived from
\i̊sebox-0.5ex~200 observations taken by the
Palomar Transient Factory of four cluster fields from 2010
February to May. Our measurements indicate that Praesepe's mass-
period relation transitions from a well-defined singular
relation to a more scattered distribution of both fast and slow
rotators at \rs̊ebox-0.5ex~0.6 M $_sun$. The
location of this transition is broadly consistent with
expectations based on observations of younger clusters and the
assumption that stellar spin-down is the dominant mechanism
influencing angular momentum evolution at 600 Myr. However, a
comparison to data recently published for the Hyades, assumed to
be coeval to Praesepe, indicates that the divergence from a
singular mass-period relation occurs at different characteristic
masses, strengthening the finding that Praesepe is the younger
of the two clusters. We also use previously published relations
describing the evolution of rotation periods as a function of
color and mass to evolve the sample of Praesepe periods in time.
Comparing the resulting predictions to periods measured in M35
and NGC 2516 (\rae̊box-0.5ex~150 Myr) and for
kinematically selected young and old field star populations
suggests that stellar spin-down may progress more slowly than
described by these relations.},
