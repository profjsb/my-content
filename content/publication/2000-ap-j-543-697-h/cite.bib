 abstract = {The optical light curve of the energetic \ensuremathγ-ray burst
GRB 991216 is consistent with jetlike behavior in which a power-
law decay steepens from t$^-1.22+/-0.04$ at early times to
t$^-1.53+/-0.05$ in a gradual transition at around 2 days. The
derivation of the late-time decay slope takes into account the
constant contribution of a host or intervening galaxy, which was
measured 110 days after the event at R=24.56+/-0.14, although
the light curve deviates from a single power law whether or not
a constant term is included. The early-time spectral energy
distribution of the afterglow can be described as F$_\ensurema
thν$åisebox-0.5ex~\ensuremathν$^-
0.74+/-0.05$ or flatter between optical and X-ray, which,
together with the slow initial decay, is characteristic of
standard adiabatic evolution in a uniformly dense medium.
Assuming that a reported absorption-line redshift of 1.02 is
correct, the apparent isotropic energy of
6.7×10$^53$ ergs is reduced by a factor of
\i̊sebox-0.5ex~200 in the jet model, and the
initial half-opening angle is
\rs̊ebox-0.5ex~6°. GRB 991216 is
the third good example of a jetlike afterglow (following GRB
990123 and GRB 990510), supporting a trend in which the
apparently most energetic \ensuremathγ-ray events have
the narrowest collimation and a uniform interstellar medium
environment. This, plus the absence of evidence for supernovae
associated with jetlike afterglows, suggests that these events
may originate from a progenitor in which angular momentum plays
an important role but a massive stellar envelope or wind does
not, e.g., in the coalescence of a compact binary.},
