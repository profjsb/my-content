 abstract = {We investigate the prompt emission and the afterglow properties of
short-duration gamma-ray burst (sGRB) 130603B and another eight
sGRB events during 2012-2015, observed by several
multiwavelength facilities including the Gran Canarias Telescope
10.4 m telescope. Prompt emission high energy data of the events
were obtained by INTEGRAL-SPI-ACS, Swift-BAT, and Fermi-GBM
satellites. The prompt emission data by INTEGRAL in the energy
range of 0.1-10 MeV for sGRB 130603B, sGRB 140606A, sGRB
140930B, sGRB 141212A, and sGRB 151228A do not show any
signature of the extended emission or precursor activity and
their spectral and temporal properties are similar to those seen
in case of other short bursts. For sGRB 130603B, our new
afterglow photometric data constrain the pre-jet-break temporal
decay due to denser temporal coverage. For sGRB 130603B, the
afterglow light curve, containing both our new and previously
published photometric data is broadly consistent with the ISM
afterglow model. Modeling of the host galaxies of sGRB 130603B
and sGRB 141212A using the LePHARE software supports a scenario
in which the environment of the burst is undergoing moderate
star formation activity. From the inclusion of our late-time
data for eight other sGRBs we are able to: place tight
constraints on the non-detection of the afterglow, host galaxy,
or any underlying `kilonova' emission. Our late-time afterglow
observations of the sGRB 170817A/GW170817 are also discussed and
compared with the sub-set of sGRBs.},
