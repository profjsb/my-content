 abstract = {We present a Bayesian analysis of the distances to 15,040 Large
Magellanic Cloud (LMC) RR Lyrae stars using $V$- and $I$-band
light curves from the Optical Gravitational Lensing Experiment,
in combination with new $z$-band observations from the Dark
Energy Camera. Our median individual RR Lyrae distance
statistical error is 1.89 kpc (fractional distance error of 3.76
per cent). We present three-dimensional contour plots of the
number density of LMC RR Lyrae stars and measure a distance to
the core LMC RR Lyrae centre of $50.2482±0.0546
m̊(statistical) ±0.4628 \(̊systematic) \rk̊pc$,
equivalently $μ_\rmM̊C=18.5056±0.0024 \rm(åtistical)
±0.02 \rm(st̊ematic)$. This finding is statistically
consistent with and four times more precise than the canonical
value determined by a recent meta-analysis of 233 separate LMC
distance determinations. We also measure a maximum tilt angle of
$11.84^∘±0.80^∘$ at a position angle of
$62^∘$, and report highly precise constraints on the $V$,
$I$, and $z$ RR Lyrae period--magnitude relations. The full
dataset of observed mean-flux magnitudes, derived colour excess
$E(V-I)$ values, and fitted distances for the 15,040 RR Lyrae
stars produced through this work is made available through the
publication's associated online data. <P />},
