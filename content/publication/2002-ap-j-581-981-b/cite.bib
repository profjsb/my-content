 abstract = {We present ground-based optical observations of GRB 020124 starting 1.6
hr after the burst, as well as subsequent Very Large Array and
Hubble Space Telescope (HST) observations. The optical afterglow
of GRB 020124 is one of the faintest afterglows detected to
date, and it exhibits a relatively rapid decay, F$_\ensuremath
ν$åisebox-0.5ex~t$^-1.60+/-0.04$,
followed by further steepening. In addition, a weak radio source
was found coincident with the optical afterglow. The HST
observations reveal that a positionally coincident host galaxy
must be the faintest host to date,
R&gt;\i̊sebox-0.5ex~29.5 mag. The afterglow
observations can be explained by several models requiring little
or no extinction within the host galaxy,
A$^host$$_V$\rs̊ebox-0.5ex~0-0.9 mag. These
observations have significant implications for the
interpretation of the so-called dark bursts (bursts for which no
optical afterglow is detected), which are usually attributed to
dust extinction within the host galaxy. The faintness and
relatively rapid decay of the afterglow of GRB 020124, combined
with the low inferred extinction, indicate that some dark bursts
are intrinsically dim and not dust obscured. Thus, the diversity
in the underlying properties of optical afterglows must be
observationally determined before substantive inferences can be
drawn from the statistics of dark bursts.},
