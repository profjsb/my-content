 abstract = {Emission lines in X-ray spectra of clusters of galaxies reveal the
presence of heavy elements in the diffuse hot plasma (ICM) in
virial equilibrium in the dark matter potential well. Thanks to
the X-ray satellites Chandra and XMM-Newton we are now able to
measure with good accuracy the distribution and evolution of
Iron up to redshift z åisebox-0.5ex~ 1.3. The
capability of studying the chemical and thermodynamical
properties of the ICM in high redshift clusters is an efficient
tool to constrain the interaction processes between the cluster
galaxies and the surrounding medium. We confirm that the ICM is
already significantly enriched at a look-back time of 9 Gyr, and
find that the Iron abundance change with redshift as
(1+z)(̂-1.25), implying an increase of a factor of
\i̊sebox-0.5ex~2 with respect to z=1.3. This
result can be explained by a prompt enrichment by star formation
processes in massive ellipticals at z&gt;2, followed by a
slower release of enriched gas from disk galaxies into the ICM,
associated to a morphological transition from disk to S0.},
