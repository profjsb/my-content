 abstract = {We present photometry and spectroscopy of the peculiar Type II supernova
SN 2010jp, also named PTF10aaxi. The light curve exhibits a
linear decline with a relatively low peak absolute magnitude of
only -15.9 (unfiltered), and a low radioactive decay luminosity
at late times that suggests a low synthesized nickel mass of
about 0.003 M $_☉$ or less. Spectra of SN 2010jp display an
unprecedented triple-peaked H\ensuremathα line profile,
showing: (1) a narrow central component that suggests shock
interaction with a dense circumstellar medium (CSM); (2) high-
velocity blue and red emission features centered at -12,600 and
+15,400 km s$^-1$ and (3) very broad wings extending from
-22,000 to +25,000 km s$^-1$. We propose that this line
profile indicates a bipolar jet-driven explosion, with the
central component produced by normal SN ejecta and CSM
interaction at mid and low latitudes, while the high-velocity
bumps and broad line wings arise in a nonrelativistic bipolar
jet. Jet-driven SNe II are predicted for collapsars resulting
from a wide range of initial masses above 25 M $_☉$,
especially at the sub-solar metallicity consistent with the SN
host environment. It also seems consistent with the apparently
low $^56$Ni mass that may accompany black hole formation. We
speculate that the jet survives to produce observable signatures
because the star's H envelope was very low mass, having been
mostly stripped away by the previous eruptive mass loss. <P />},
