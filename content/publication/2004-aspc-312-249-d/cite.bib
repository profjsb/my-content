 abstract = {Studies of the cosmic gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) and their host galaxies
are starting to provide interesting or even unique new insights
in observational cosmology. GRBs represent a new way of
identifying a population of star-forming galaxies at
cosmological redshifts. GRB hosts are broadly similar to the
normal field galaxy populations at comparable redshifts and
magnitudes, and indicate at most a mild luminosity evolution out
to z Ìƒ 1.5 - 2. GRB optical afterglows seen in absorption
provide a powerful new probe of the ISM in dense, central
regions of their host galaxies, complementary to the traditional
studies using QSO absorbers. Some GRB hosts are heavily
obscured, and provide a new way to select a population of
cosmological sub-mm sources, and a novel constraint on the total
obscured fraction of star formation over the history of the
universe. Finally, detection of GRB afterglows at z &gt; 6 may
provide a unique way to probe the primordial star formation,
massive IMF, early IGM, and chemical enrichment at the end of
the cosmic reionization era. <P />},
