 abstract = {Ground-based robotic telescopes have proven essential in the first 6
months of Swift operation. The robotic optical 0.7m Katzman
Automatic Imaging Telescope (KAIT) and the robotic infra-red
1.3m Peters Automated Infrared Imaging Telescope (PAIRITEL) have
contributed important observations during this period, and we
discuss efforts to leverage the capabilities of each system to
perform rapid, joint observations in the optical and infra-red.
An autonomously paired KAIT/PAIRITEL system offers the potential
to rapidly discover highly dust extincted bursts or bursts
occurring at high redshifts (z
&gt;Ã¥isebox-0.5ex~ 5) as near-IR dropouts. <P
