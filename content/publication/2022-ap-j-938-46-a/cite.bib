 abstract = {The orbital-period (P $_orb$) gap in the population of cataclysmic
variables (CVs) informs the theoretical narrative of CV
evolution, yet a complete understanding of the driving angular
momentum loss mechanisms above and below this gap remains
elusive. Here we identify, for standard CVs, a new, apparently
monotonic relationship between quiescent color (G $_BP$-G
$_RP$), absolute magnitude (M $_ G $), and P $_orb$
(between 70 minutes and 8 hr) revealed in Gaia DR2 and EDR3. We
show that P $_orb$ increases in the color-absolute-magnitude
diagram roughly orthogonally to the white dwarf and main
sequences. We find the orbital-period-color-absolute-magnitude
relationship to be stable across different CV subtypes: dwarf
novae, intermediate polars, polars, and novalike systems. We
place our findings in context with the known semiempirical donor
sequence for CVs and find a dependence between color and M $_ G
$ for a given P $_orb$ specifically for dwarf novae and
intermediate polars above the period gap. These relations have
the potential to inform a more complete picture of CV evolution.},
