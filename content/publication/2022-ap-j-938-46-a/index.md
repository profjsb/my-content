abstract: 'The orbital-period (P $_orb$) gap in the population of cataclysmic variables
  (CVs) informs the theoretical narrative of CV evolution, yet a complete understanding
  of the driving angular momentum loss mechanisms above and below this gap remains
  elusive. Here we identify, for standard CVs, a new, apparently monotonic relationship
  between quiescent color (G $_BP$-G $_RP$), absolute magnitude (M $_ G $), and P
  $_orb$ (between 70 minutes and 8 hr) revealed in Gaia DR2 and EDR3. We show that
  P $_orb$ increases in the color-absolute-magnitude diagram roughly orthogonally
  to the white dwarf and main sequences. We find the orbital-period-color-absolute-magnitude
  relationship to be stable across different CV subtypes: dwarf novae, intermediate
  polars, polars, and novalike systems. We place our findings in context with the
  known semiempirical donor sequence for CVs and find a dependence between color and
  M $_ G $ for a given P $_orb$ specifically for dwarf novae and intermediate polars
  above the period gap. These relations have the potential to inform a more complete
  picture of CV evolution.'
