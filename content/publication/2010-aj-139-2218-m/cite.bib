 abstract = {Supernova (SN) 2006gy was a hydrogen-rich core-collapse SN that remains
one of the most luminous optical SNe ever observed. The total
energy budget (&gt;2 × 10$^51$ erg radiated in
the optical alone) poses many challenges for standard SN theory.
We present new ground-based near-infrared (NIR) observations of
SN 2006gy, as well as a single epoch of Hubble Space Telescope
(HST) imaging obtained more than two years after the explosion.
Our NIR data taken around peak optical emission show an
evolution that is largely consistent with a cooling blackbody,
with tentative evidence for a growing NIR excess starting around
day åisebox-0.5ex~130. Our late-time Keck
adaptive optics NIR image, taken on day 723, shows little change
from previous NIR observations taken around day 400.
Furthermore, the optical HST observations show a reduced decline
rate after day 400, and the SN is bluer on day 810 than it was
at peak. This late-time decline is inconsistent with $^56$Co
decay, and thus is problematic for the various pair-instability
SN models used to explain the nature of SN 2006gy. The slow
decline of the NIR emission can be explained with a light echo,
and we confirm that the late-time NIR excess is the result of a
massive (gsim10 M $_sun$) dusty shell heated by the SN peak
luminosity. The late-time optical observations require the
existence of a scattered light echo, which may be generated by
the same dust that contributes to the NIR echo. Both the NIR and
optical echoes originate in the proximity of the progenitor,
\i̊sebox-0.5ex~10$^18$ cm for the NIR echo
and lsim10-40 pc for the optical echo, which provides further
evidence that the progenitor of SN 2006gy was a very massive
star.},
