 abstract = {We present optical and infrared monitoring of the 2005 outburst of the
halo black hole X-ray transient XTE J1118+480. We measured a
total outburst amplitude of
åisebox-0.5ex~5.7+/-0.1 mag in the R band and
\i̊sebox-0.5ex~5 mag in the infrared J, H, and
K$_s$ bands. The hardness ratio HR2 (5-12 keV:3-5 keV) from
the RXTE ASM data is 1.53+/-0.02 at the peak of the outburst,
indicating a hard spectrum. Both the shape of the light curve
and the ratio L$_X$(1-10 keV)/L$_opt$ resemble the
minioutbursts observed in GRO J0422+32 and XTE J1859+226. During
early decline, we find a 0.02 mag amplitude variation consistent
with a superhump modulation, like the one observed during the
2000 outburst. Similarly, XTE J1118+480 displayed a double-
humped ellipsoidal modulation distorted by a superhump wave when
settled into a near-quiescence level, suggesting that the disk
expanded to the 3:1 resonance radius after outburst, where it
remained until early quiescence. The system reached quiescence
at R=19.02+/-0.03, about 3 months after the onset of the
outburst. The optical rise preceded the X-ray rise by at most 4
days. The spectral energy distributions (SEDs) at the different
epochs during outburst are all quasi-power laws with F$_\ensur
emathν$\rs̊ebox-0.5ex~\ensuremathν$
^\ensuremathα$ increasing toward the blue. At the
peak of the outburst, we derived
\ensuremathα=0.49+/-0.04 for the optical data alone and
\ensuremathα=0.1+/-0.1 when fitting solely the
infrared. This difference between the optical and the infrared
SEDs suggests that the infrared is dominated by a different
component (a jet?), whereas the optical is presumably showing
the disk evolution.},
