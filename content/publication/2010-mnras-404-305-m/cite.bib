 abstract = {We present spectroscopic and photometric observations of the Type IIn
supernova (SN) 2008iy. SN 2008iy showed an unprecedentedly long
rise time of åisebox-0.5ex~400 d, making it
the first known SN to take significantly longer than 100 d to
reach peak optical luminosity. The peak absolute magnitude of SN
2008iy was M$_r$ \i̊sebox-0.5ex~ -19.1 mag,
and the total radiated energy over the first
\rs̊ebox-0.5ex~700 d was
\rae̊box-0.5ex~2 × 10$^50$ erg.
Spectroscopically, SN 2008iy is very similar to the Type IIn SN
1988Z at late times and, like SN 1988Z, it is a luminous X-ray
source (both SNe had an X-ray luminosity L$_X$ &gt;
10$^41$ ergs$^-1$). SN 2008iy has a growing near-infrared
excess at late times similar to several other SNe IIn. The
H\ensuremathα emission-line profile of SN 2008iy shows
a narrow P Cygni absorption component, implying a pre-SN wind
speed of \raib̊ox-0.5ex~100kms$^-1$. We argue
that the luminosity of SN 2008iy is powered via the interaction
of the SN ejecta with a dense, clumpy circumstellar medium. The
\raiso̊x-0.5ex~400-d rise time can be
understood if the number density of clumps increases with
distance over a radius \raisex̊-0.5ex~1.7
× 10$^16$cm from the progenitor. This scenario is
possible if the progenitor experienced an episodic phase of
enhanced mass loss &lt;1 century prior to explosion or if the
progenitor wind speed increased during the decades before core
collapse. We favour the former scenario, which is reminiscent of
the eruptive mass-loss episodes observed for luminous blue
variable (LBV) stars. The progenitor wind speed and increased
mass-loss rates serve as further evidence that at least some,
and perhaps all, Type IIn SNe experience LBV-like eruptions
shortly before core collapse. We also discuss the host galaxy of
SN 2008iy, a subluminous dwarf galaxy, and offer a few reasons
why the recent suggestion that unusual, luminous SNe
preferentially occur in dwarf galaxies may be the result of
observational biases.},
