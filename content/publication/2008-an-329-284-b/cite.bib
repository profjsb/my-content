 abstract = {Temporal sampling does more than add another axis to the vector of
observables. Instead, under the recognition that how objects
change (and move) in time speaks directly to the physics
underlying astronomical phenomena, next-generation wide-field
synoptic surveys are poised to revolutionize our understanding
of just about anything that goes bump in the night (which is
just about everything at some level). Still, even the most
ambitious surveys will require targeted spectroscopic follow-up
to fill in the physical details of newly discovered transients.
We are now building a new system intended to ingest and classify
transient phenomena in near real-time from high-throughput
imaging data streams. Described herein, the Transient
Classification Project at Berkeley will be making use of
classification techniques operating on ``features`` extracted
from time series and contextual (static) information. We also
highlight the need for a community adoption of a standard
representation of astronomical time series data (ie.
``VOTimeseries''). <P />},
