 abstract = {We report observations of a possible young transiting planet orbiting a
previously known weak-lined T-Tauri star in the 7-10 Myr old
Orion-OB1a/25-Ori region. The candidate was found as part of the
Palomar Transient Factory (PTF) Orion project. It has a
photometric transit period of 0.448413 \ensuremath±
0.000040 days, and appears in both 2009 and 2010 PTF data.
Follow-up low-precision radial velocity (RV) observations and
adaptive optics imaging suggest that the star is not an
eclipsing binary, and that it is unlikely that a background
source is blended with the target and mimicking the observed
transit. RV observations with the Hobby-Eberly and Keck
telescopes yield an RV that has the same period as the
photometric event, but is offset in phase from the transit
center by \ensuremath≈ - 0.22 periods. The amplitude
(half range) of the RV variations is 2.4 km s$^-1$ and is
comparable with the expected RV amplitude that stellar spots
could induce. The RV curve is likely dominated by stellar spot
modulation and provides an upper limit to the projected
companion mass of M $_p$sin i $_orb$
&lt;åisebox-0.5ex~ 4.8 \ensuremath± 1.2
M $_Jup$; when combined with the orbital inclination, i
$_orb$, of the candidate planet from modeling of the transit
light curve, we find an upper limit on the mass of the planetary
candidate of M $_p$ &lt;\i̊sebox-0.5ex~ 5.5
\ensuremath± 1.4 M $_Jup$. This limit implies that the
planet is orbiting close to, if not inside, its Roche limiting
orbital radius, so that it may be undergoing active mass loss
and evaporation.},
