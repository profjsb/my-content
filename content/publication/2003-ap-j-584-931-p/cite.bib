 abstract = {GRB 010921 was the first HETE-2 gamma-ray burst (GRB) to be localized
via its afterglow emission. The low redshift of the host galaxy,
z=0.451, prompted us to undertake intensive multicolor
observations with the Hubble Space Telescope with the goal of
searching for an underlying supernova (SN) component. We do not
detect any coincident SN to a limit 1.33 mag fainter than SN
1998bw at 99.7% confidence, making this one of the most
sensitive searches for an underlying SN. Analysis of the
afterglow data allows us to infer that the GRB was situated
behind a net extinction (Milky Way and the host galaxy) of
A$_V$Ã¥isebox-0.5ex~1.8 mag in the observer
frame. Thus, had it not been for such heavy extinction, our data
would have allowed us to probe for an underlying SN with
brightness approaching those of more typical Type Ib/c SNe.},
