 abstract = {We present spectroscopic observations of the host galaxy of GRB 980703.
Several emission and absorption features are detected, making
the redshift (z=0.966) completely unambiguous. This is only the
third known redshift for a \ensuremathγ-ray burst (GRB)
host. The implied isotropic \ensuremathγ-ray energy
release from the burst is in excess of 10$^53$ ergs for a
reasonable choice of cosmological parameters. The spectroscopic
properties of the host galaxy are typical for a star formation-
powered object. Using the observed value of the Balmer
decrement, we derived the extinction in the galaxy's rest frame:
A$_V$åisebox-0.5ex~0.3+/-0.3 mag. Using
three different star formation rate (SFR) indicators, we
estimate SFR\i̊sebox-0.5ex~10 M$_solar$
yr$^-1$ or higher, depending on the extinction, with a lower
limit of SFR&gt;7 M$_solar$ yr$^-1$. This is the highest
value of the SFR measured for a GRB galaxy so far, and it gives
some support to the idea that GRBs are closely related to
massive star formation. <P />Based in part on observations
obtained at the W. K. Keck Observatory, which is operated by the
California Association for Research in Astronomy, a scientific
partnership among the California Institute of Technology, the
University of California, and the National Aeronautics and Space
Administration.},
