abstract: "We present spectroscopic observations of the host galaxy of GRB 980703. Several emission and absorption features are detected, making the redshift (z=0.966) completely unambiguous. This is only the third known redshift for a γ-ray burst (GRB) host. The implied isotropic γ-ray energy release from the burst is in excess of 10$^53$ ergs for a reasonable choice of cosmological parameters. The spectroscopic properties of the host galaxy are typical for a star formation- powered object. Using the observed value of the Balmer decrement, we derived the extinction in the galaxy's rest frame: A$_V$åisebox-0.5ex 0.3+/-0.3 mag. Using three different star formation rate (SFR) indicators, we estimate SFRi̊sebox-0.5ex 10 M$_solar$ yr$^-1$ or higher, depending on the extinction, with a lower limit of SFR&gt;7 M$_solar$ yr$^-1$. This is the highest value of the SFR measured for a GRB galaxy so far, and it gives some support to the idea that GRBs are closely related to massive star formation. <P />Based in part on observations obtained at the W. K. Keck Observatory, which is operated by the California Association for Research in Astronomy, a scientific partnership among the California Institute of Technology, the University of California, and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration."
